          "context": "In Europe, Sanskrit academic research was initiated by German scholars Lut and Hans Rayton. Later, William Jones discovered the Indo-European language, also thanks to the study of Sanskrit. In addition, Sanskrit studies have contributed a lot to the development of Western philology and historical linguistics. On February 2, 1786, the Asia Society was held in Kolkata. During the meeting, William Jones published the following famous remark: \"Sanskrit is very old, but the structure is subtle: it is more perfect than Greek, richer than Latin, and exquisite is better than both, but in The verb root and grammatical form are similar to the two, and it is impossible to be the result of coincidence. These three languages are too similar, so that any linguist who simultaneously examines the three must have to believe that the three are the same source. From a language that may have disappeared. For similar reasons, despite the lack of equally strong evidence, we can deduce that German and Celtic, although mixed into a different vocabulary, have the same origin as Sanskrit; The language may also be a descendant of this language family.\"",

In India, the form of writing occurs only after the Sanskrit has developed into a colloquial language; when writing Sanskrit, the choice of the writing system is influenced by the geographical location of the scribe. Similarly, all the major writing systems in South Asia are actually used for the transcription of Sanskrit manuscripts. Since the late 19th century, Tianchengwen has been designated as the standard writing system for Sanskrit. The most likely reason is that Europeans have the habit of printing Sanskrit texts with such words. The earliest known Sanskrit inscriptions can be identified as the first century BC. They use Borneo, originally used for proverbs rather than Sanskrit. The first evidence of Sanskrit appeared in centuries after the written evidence of its proverbs, which was described as a paradox. When Sanskrit was written, it was first used in administrative, literary or scientific texts. The religious text was passed down orally, and was written \"reluctantly\" at a very late time.",

The Central Committee for Secondary Education in India has made Sanskrit a third language in the schools it controls. In these schools, Sanskrit is an elective in grades 5-8. This is also true for schools affiliated with the All India Indian Secondary Education Commission, especially in the state where the official language is Hindi. The only Sanskrit-language daily newspaper, Sudarmo, was published in Mysore, India, in 1970. Since 1974, there have been Sanskrit daily short news broadcasts on all Indian radio stations.

Every 15 years, the property value was assessed for taxation and became an era unit of ancient Rome. Therefore, 7980 is a Julian cycle. The selected starting point in 4713 BC is the most recent year in which the three cycles start simultaneously. Due to the large number of digits on Julian Day, the International Astronomical Union adopted the simplified Julian Day in 1973, which was defined as the simplified Julian Day = Julian Day -2400000.5. The corresponding starting point for Julian Day is 0:00 on November 17, 1858.",

Tennis is now an Olympic event, suitable for all walks of life and age groups. Modern tennis originated from \"grass tennis\" in Birmingham, England. In 1890, the rules of the tennis match were finalized, and the adjustments have not been made so far. The only changes include specifying the position of the serve and introducing the \"penalty rule\", and the first trial of the 7th US Open in the 1970 US Open. Recently, the tennis competition has introduced electronic monitoring systems and player challenge rules, giving players the opportunity to use technical means to determine whether the ball is out of bounds. There are a large number of spectators in the tennis competition, and the four major slam tournaments have received special attention, including the Australian Open, Wimbledon, French Open and the US Open.",

Their main job is to decide whether the ball falls within the specified area and to check whether the player is violating the serve. In addition, a network clerk can be set up to determine whether the ball touches the net when serving. There may also be a caddy in the game, responsible for the ball and handing the ball and towel to the player. They are not responsible for the ruling of the game. Off-court referees generally sit in the audience and have the final interpretation of the rules of the game. The tennis match should be continuous, because the athlete's physical ability is also one of the determinants of the game's outcome. In most cases, the serve should be played within 20 seconds of the last score; the player should serve within 90 seconds after the exchange. There is a 120 second break after each game. Usually in a formal match, if a player is injured, a limited number of short pauses are allowed to call the therapist to enter the treatment. In addition to this, other behaviors that delay the progress of the game will be warned or even penalized.",

Later, the game was developed and improved, the net was used instead of the rope, and the ball was changed to a wooden racket, then the wooden racket was pulled up. Since the 18th century, European folks have also begun to play this kind of game, and it was popular in Europe in the 19th century. Modern tennis was invented in the UK in December 1873 by Major Walter Colopton Winfield, a game that was used to delight guests in the backyard party. He created the sport based on old indoor tennis or a game called original tennis.

The lower spin ball is easy to control, and can play long or short balls to confuse the opponent. It is often used to go online with the ball, and it is more labor-saving when hitting the ball. The downside is that the attack power is not great. The forehand cut ball can be used alternately with the top spin and the flat shot to exchange the rotation and the rhythm ball, disturbing the rhythm of the opponent, making it difficult for the opponent to return the ball. The interception is the hitting of the opponent's field before returning to the opponent's returning ball. Usually, based on the judgment of the opponent's returning direction, the opponent moves to the position close to the net. The return is performed. Hard to reach. Interception is very important in the doubles and serves as the key to success. The smash is when the opponent's return height is too high and the depth is too shallow. You can use a similar serve action to quickly hit the ball back to the opponent's field in a pressurized manner to produce a winning ball, but if the smash is too shallow, the smash It is easy to be attacked by the opponent in the backcourt. If you smash and ask for a blow, you will score. If there is too much confrontation with the opponent after the smash, this will be bad for yourself. Therefore, it is best to buckle directly to the backcourt or pull the angle. Let the opponents have no time to react.",

The Latin name and the way of adding words are systematically named for the animal. Since then, the double name method has gradually been accepted by the academic community and become an academic naming method common to all living things. Since 1758, biology has developed rapidly, and people's understanding of animals has continued to deepen. On the one hand, we have deepened our understanding of the animals we have already known, and on the other hand, we have discovered a large number of new species. The whole animal classification system has undergone tremendous changes. For example, Linnai used to have all the insects in the same species. 42 species of insects belong to one genus, but by 1930 there have been about 5,000 genera and 30,000 species under this suborder.",

Revelation is traditionally believed to have been written by the apostle John, as well as the John and John letters, and he was written with revelation when he was exiled to the island of Patmos during the reign of the Roman emperor Tu Mishan. The author of Revelation has repeatedly called himself \"John\" and stated that he accepted his first vision on the island of Patmos, and is therefore sometimes referred to as \"the John of Pulling.\" The martyr Justin may have mentioned this book and thought it was from the apostle John.

Urban planning practitioners focus on research and analysis, strategic thinking, architecture and urban design, public consultation, policy advice, implementation and management. Urban planners work with cross-cutting areas such as architecture, landscape, civil engineering and public administration to achieve strategic, policy and sustainable development goals.

The space between them remains the same, such as the World Wide Web. This change is in line with the logic of establishing an encyclopedia, and is very precise about the name. Wikimedia uses an extensible, lightweight wiki-tagged language that is easier to learn and use than a super-file markup language. The tool has a conversion that switches the table between the Wikimedia tag and the hyperfile markup language. Despite attempts to create a Wikimedia tagged language specification, the consensus seems to have reached the point where wiki code requires contextual grammar.",

At present, there are dozens of methods for temperature measurement. According to the measurement principle, it can be divided into the following categories: expansion temperature measurement method, which uses geometric quantity as a symbol of temperature. For example, the measurement range of a mercury thermometer is about -30 to 300 ° C, and the measurement range of an alcohol thermometer is about -115 to 110 ° C. The electrical temperature measurement method uses some electrical quantity such as a resistance change with temperature as a temperature mark. Resistance thermometers are mostly used below 600 ° C, thermocouple thermometer measurement range is generally below 1600 ° C, in addition to semiconductor thermistor thermometer. The magnetic temperature measurement method measures the temperature according to the relationship between the magnetic susceptibility of the paramagnetic substance and the temperature, and is commonly used in ultra-low temperature measurement. Acoustic temperature measurement, using the speed of sound as a temperature mark. Mainly used for the determination of thermodynamic temperature at low temperatures. The frequency temperature measurement method measures the temperature according to the change of the natural frequency of the object. The resolution of a quartz crystal thermometer can reach one ten thousandth of a degree Celsius. The optical temperature measurement method measures the temperature based on black body radiation. Such as infrared thermometers. Density temperature measurement methods, such as Galileo thermometers.",

The Lower Saxony and Bremen are mutually beneficial, and the two cities of Bremen and Bremen are not only divided into two by Lower Saxony, but also by Lower Saxony. The Weser River, which originated in central Germany, flows through the vast Lower Saxony, passes through Bremen and eventually flows into the North Sea in Bremerhaven. In the Weser River's water conservation, river reconstruction, navigation and economic utilization, the two states need to communicate closely, so this river has become a natural link between the two states. The cooperation between Bremen and Bremerhaven and the surrounding Lower Saxony towns, residential areas and industrial parks is interlinked, so the cooperation between the two states is particularly important. In order to conduct better consultations on the initiatives and implementation of the cooperation between the two states, the cabinet members of the two states hold a joint cabinet meeting every year. At the same time, the State Council members under the ministers conduct regular consultations. The two states also launched the “Bremen-Odenburg Metropolitan Circle” project to jointly promote the development and cooperation in the northwest. These gradually established consultation mechanisms effectively avoided negative and disorderly competition between Lower Saxony and Bremen.",

After the founding of the Republic of China, Guangzhou Prefecture was abolished and Xiangshan County was directly affiliated to the province. In March of the 14th year of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen passed away. In April of the 14th year of the Republic of China, the Lunar New Marshal House of the Republic of China, located in Guangzhou, commemorated Sun Yat-sen and decided to rename Sun Yat-sen’s hometown of Xiangshan County, Zhongshan County. In February 1929, the 19th State Council of the National Government was identified as a national model county directly under the National Government. In June 1930, the county government moved to Zhongshan Port in Tangjiahuan until October 1934 when it moved back to Shijie.

When the seedlings are pumping high and growing the first rice stem, it is called the tillering period. During this period, fertilization is often needed to make the rice seedling grow robust and promote the fullness and quantity of the rice in the future. For high-yield super rice, the fertilization amount per hectare is 160-220 kg of nitrogen, 575-100 kg of hypophosphorus oxide, and 50-75 kg of potassium oxide. Rice is more dependent on irrigation and drainage. If the dry rice is dry field, the process of irrigation and drainage is different. However, it is generally necessary to strengthen the water irrigation after the transplanting, when the young spikes are formed, and during the flowering period. With the improvement of modern weeding technology, fertilization techniques and varieties, and the promotion of advanced technologies such as dry and thin planting, it is now generally practiced to perform shallow irrigation at the tillering stage, and the method of interstitial irrigation for young spikes begins to differentiate into young spikes. In the middle and late stages, if it encounters low temperature, it will be deeply watered to prevent low temperature chilling.",

In addition to rice bran oil, rice bran protein and rice bran nutrients are the main research directions of scientists. Therefore, there are many health foods, health supplements, and even daily necessities on the market that are advertised to emphasize the ingredients of fresh rice bran. Similar to rice bran, rice bran, the shell of rice, is an important source of animal feed. It is also used as a building material. Many traditional mud houses in the Asian countryside, such as the round earth buildings in the Hakka villages of China, contain rice bran in the material. In modern society, rice bran has also been tried on cement mixed materials, or used to produce calcium phytate and inositol. Straw is another economical by-product that is quite distinctive and has many uses. In addition to livestock for cattle and sheep, straw ropes, sandals and robes made of straw are essential for many farmers. In the early days, many houses were made of straw.",

Now, this practice of international star registration has been officially labeled, a scam and fraud; the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs also issued an international star registration is illegal to engage in fraudulent trade. Astronomers have always had different estimates of the number of stars in the universe. One of the most famous claims is the American astronomer Carl Sagan's speculation in his book \"100 Billion Billion\" that there are 100 billion galaxies in the universe, each with 100 billion stars. According to this, astronomers further speculated that the number of stars in each galaxy is about one trillion times that of 100 billion. American astronomer Peter Van Dokun and astrophysicist Charlie Conroy analyzed the light intensity from the galaxy and thought it was about 3 times 10 to the power of 23.",

Astronomers determine the mass, age, amount of metal, and many other properties of a star by observing its motion, brightness, and spectrum in space. The total mass of a star is the main factor in the evolution of stars and in determining the final fate: stars in their lifetime, including diameter, temperature and other characteristics, change at different stages of life, and the environment around the stars affects their rotation and movement. . A graph depicting the temperature of many stars versus brightness, the Hertograph, allows us to measure the age and evolution of a star. The life of a star begins with the gravitational contraction of a gaseous nebula. Once the core has sufficient density, the nuclear fusion reaction of hydrogen fusion into helium can be carried out steadily and continuously, releasing the energy generated during the process.",

In addition to individual stars, a star system can have two or more stars bound by gravity and intertwined in orbit. The most common star system is the twin star, but a system with three or more stars is also found. Because of the stability of the orbit, these star systems often form a common system of star systems. There are also larger groups known as clusters.

For ground-based telescopes, most of the stellar disks are too small to detect their angular diameters, so interferometer telescopes are needed to obtain images of these stars. Another technique for measuring the diameter of a stellar angle is the occultation: this technique accurately measures the luminosity of the moon as it is masked by the moon, from which the apparent diameter of the star can be calculated. The size of the stars, from as small as 20 to 40 kilometers of neutron stars, to the superstars like Orion's four, the diameter of the sun is 650 times, about 900 million kilometers, but the density is much lower than the sun.",

A conductive plasma-like generator that causes a magnetic field that extends in the star.

The surface activity produces star spots, which are areas where the surface magnetic field is stronger than normal and the temperature is lower than normal. The arched star-shaped circle is the aura that enters the star from the active area of the magnetic field. The star flame is a phenomenon of high-energy particles erupted by the same magnetic field activity. Young, high-speed spinning stars tend to have high surface activity due to the activity of the magnetic field. The magnetic field also enhances the stellar wind, but the rate of rotation is like a gate, which gradually slows down as the star ages. Therefore, a star such as the sun has a lower rate of rotation and a milder surface activity. The degree of slow-moving stellar activity tends to change periodically and may temporarily cease activity during the cycle. For example, in the case of Mond's minima, the sun has almost no sunspot activity for about 70 years.",

It is the star with the smallest known mass but the core can still undergo nuclear fusion. A star with a similar metal mass to the sun, theoretically still capable of performing a nuclear fusion reaction, has a minimum mass estimate of about 75 times the mass of Jupiter. When the amount of metal is very low, based on the current study of the darkest stars, it is found that the smallest stellar mass seems to be only 8.3% of the Sun or 87 times the mass of Jupiter. The smaller stars are the gray areas between the stars and the gas giants, and there are no clearly defined brown dwarfs. Combined with the radius and mass of the star, the gravity of the surface of the star can be determined. The gravity of the surface of the star is much lower than that of the main sequence star, and the surface gravity is stronger than the state of the degenerate, like a white dwarf star. Surface gravity also affects the spectrum of the star, and the higher the gravity, the more pronounced the broadening of the absorption line.",

Particle radiation is emitted by the stellar wind, and microneutrons from the core are also stable in the stellar wind. The energy produced at the core will make the star so bright—any time when two or more nuclei of an element fuse together and combine into a heavier new element, the gamma rays and photons are released via the nuclear reaction. come out.

Using stellar spectra, astronomers can measure the surface temperature, surface gravity, metal mass, and rate of rotation of stars.

The main reason for the variable stars, the main types can be divided into three main groups. During the evolution of stars, some stars will pass through the stage of expansion and contraction. The expanding and contracting variable stars change the radius and brightness over time. Depending on the size of the star, the period of expansion and contraction can range from a few minutes to several years. These types include the Cepheid variable star and the genus-like variable star, and the long-period Mila variable star. A catastrophic star may be a variable star whose luminosity suddenly increases due to flash or mass ejection. This group includes the original stars, Wolf-Rayet stars and flash stars, and they are all superstars and superstars. The dramatic changes or explosions of the variable stars are astronomical changes, including new stars and supernovae. Having a galaxies adjacent to a white dwarf can lead to some type of spectacular explosion in this type, including Nova and La Supernova. When a white dwarf accumulates hydrogen from a companion star, it will increase the mass and cause hydrogen to undergo nuclear fusion. Some new stars will explode again and again, with periodic and moderate intensity.",

A star whose mass is several times the sun has a troposphere deep inside the star and a radiating layer outside. Smaller stars, like the sun, are the opposite, with the troposphere out. The quality of the red dwarf is less than 0.4 solar mass, and the whole is the troposphere, which prevents the troposphere that most of the stars in the core accumulate into the nucleus to change the internal structure and change as the star ages. The part that the star can see by the observer is the layer of light spheres, which is the layer of the star's plasma that becomes transparent and can transmit energy with photons. Here, the energy transmitted from the core becomes a photon that can enter freely into space, so sunspots on the photosphere, or areas with temperatures below the average, appear. The hydrogen fusion reaction is extremely sensitive to temperature, so as long as there is a small change in the temperature of the core, the reaction rate will have a significant change. The core temperature of the main sequence star can range from the 4 million gram ear of the lowest quality \"mother\" star to the 40 million gram ear of the massive \"European\" star.",

Due to the high specific heat of water, large volumes of water can stabilize the temperature, especially the ocean, while the temperature of the land adjacent to large-scale water bodies changes less. Since the inland areas of the Pangu continent are far from the ocean, the temperature in these areas varies greatly and there may be a vast desert. A large number of red layers and evaporites support this theory. During the Jurassic period, sea levels began to rise, possibly due to the acceleration of seafloor expansion. The newly formed oceanic crust raises the sea level to about 200 meters above sea level today. In addition, the Pangu Continent began to split and formed the Tethys Ocean. The temperature is gradually rising and stable. As the continents border the ocean, the desert shrinks and the humidity in the atmosphere increases.",

The high carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere makes the temperature gradient between the tropics and the polar regions smoother, and the temperature difference varies from region to region. The average temperature is about 10 degrees Celsius higher than today. In the middle of the Cretaceous period, the ocean floor temperature in the equatorial region was about 23 degrees Celsius, which may be too warm for many marine life, and the land adjacent to the equatorial ocean became a desert. The low-level oxygen circulation system in the ocean may be slow and interrupted. As a result, a large number of biological organisms cannot be decomposed smoothly, and then accumulated in large quantities, eventually depositing into oil shale. However, not all existing materials can support the above hypothesis. Even if the global climate is warm, the ice caps and glaciers in the polar regions still cause the most changes in temperature; however, there is no evidence of the existence of ice caps and glaciers in the Cretaceous. The quantitative model may not be able to reconstruct the flat temperature gradient of the Cretaceous.",

This aristocratic system was abolished in 1947 after Japan surrendered. The Sudan in Southeast Asia is a local hereditary ruler. At present, it has no real power and becomes a virtual head.

Some of the leader positions are reserved for talented people, while others are hereditary and aristocratic. At present, there are more well-known aristocratic systems, such as Paiwan and Rukai.

The economic system of the German Democratic Republic is a planned economy that organizes the production and distribution of consumer goods in accordance with the five-year plan.

Early opposition to the East German opposition was usually suppressed through cleansing and selective prosecution.

Many Protestant churches provide support to the opposition, providing venues and printing tools. Until the establishment of the Autumn Forum in 1989, most of the civil rights movements in East Germany were aimed at promoting reforms, with the least aim of abolishing the East German government. However, the opposition is still closely monitored, especially by the official and unofficial informants of the Ministry of National Security Stasi. Dissidents who suffer political persecution, harassment or long-term imprisonment for varying degrees can help East German residents to defect to the West and sometimes be kidnapped by Stasi in secret orders. In the so-called \"detention center\", Stasi used confession and solitary confinement and other compulsory means to confess political prisoners. After the 1960s, torture and other forms of torture gradually became rare, and more use of psychological torture to drag down the will of political prisoners. One of the reasons for this change is that it is difficult to obtain evidence for psychological torture.",

About a quarter of the Germans who lived in the territory of East Germany before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 left East Germany, and since then the birth rate in East Germany has been very low. But in the years before the reunification, the birth rate of East Germany exceeded that of West Germany. In contrast, during this time, the population of Poland, a neighboring country in East Germany, increased from 24 million in 1950 to 38 million, twice the population of East Germany. Like other socialist countries in Eastern Europe, East Germany implements a planned economy, similar to the Soviet Union, in stark contrast to most Western countries that practice a market economy or a mixed economy. The state establishes comprehensive production plans, production targets, prices, and allocates resources according to the plan. The mode of production is almost entirely owned by the state. For example, in 1985, the output value of state-owned enterprises or collective production accounted for 96.7% of the national net income. Residents purchase products at a fixed price, and the state provides 80% of the basic supply costs, from food to housing prices are fixed.",

In East Germany, Prius and Karat are the more popular mainstream bands, and most artists use the label of the state-owned Amiga record. Like other Eastern European countries, rock music is considered a “symbol of Western decadence”, but it is often spread in the form of dance music, light music and is only allowed to sing in German. Although young people do not agree with this approach, this is the rule of the leader of the Socialist Party. Another reason for this is that the authorities need to carefully check whether the lyrics content contains anti-government tendencies. The government supports classical music and has retained more than 50 symphony orchestras, such as the Berlin Concert Hall Orchestra in Berlin. The East German government pays particular attention to Bach, who was born in the territory of East Germany. Eisenach, the birthplace of Bach, also spent a lot of money to build a museum. In the Bach Archives in Leipzig, he collected many of his letters and recordings of his works. Every two years, many East German children will go to East Berlin to participate in the Bach Music Competition, and every four years will be held in the international Bach piano and string competition. Coincidentally, Hans Eisler, the composer of the East German song \"Rise from the Ruins\", was born in Leipzig, where Bach was the first to go.",

In 2000, he successfully held the first North-South bilateral talks with Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang and signed the \"North-South Joint Declaration.\" Kim Dae-jung won the Nobel Peace Prize in the same year. The government of Roh Moo-hyun after Kim Dae-jung basically continued the friendly policy of the former government toward the DPRK. From October 2nd to 4th, 2007, Roh Moo-hyun walked through the 38-degree line to enter North Korea, and then arrived in Pyongyang by car to hold a second North-South Korean summit meeting with Kim Jong Il. The two sides signed the \"Declaration on the Development and Peaceful Prosperity of North-South Relations.\"",

Therefore, the traditional culture of the Korean Peninsula is deeply influenced by Chinese traditional culture, but the traditional culture of the Korean Peninsula still retains its unique characteristics. Korean modern culture is the product of Korean modernization. With the development of the Korean economy and society, Korean lifestyles such as food, clothing, housing and transportation have also changed, thus building a modern Korean culture. The popularity of Korean culture in Asia and the world is known as the Korean Wave. Traditional architecture in South Korea has many similarities with traditional buildings in China and Japan, and is influenced by yin and yang, the Five Elements of Heaven and Earth, Feng Shui, Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. Nature is the most important factor in Korean architecture. Korean architecture does not pursue grandeur, but emphasizes the respect of architecture for nature and harmony with nature. Traditional Korean architecture rarely flaunts in scale and decoration. The rooms are relatively small and the decor is simpler. It is believed that the rooms of people with rich self-cultivation and gentlemanliness are mainly used for reading and talking about academics, and should not appear flashy on the decoration.",

Most of the early literature was burned in previous wars, and there are few reciting books available for reference. The \"Guige Song\" recorded in \"The Three Kingdoms\" is the earliest surviving ancient Korean song. The \"Yellow Bird Song\" of Goguryeo Liuli Ming Wang in the Three Kingdoms Period is the earliest Korean poetry in Korea. During the unification of the Silla period, Korean classical literature prospered unprecedentedly. The Mandarin song \"Hometown Song\" reached its peak in the 1989 and the ninth century. Influenced by the Tang dynasty Han culture, the unified Silla appeared strong first, Xue Cong, Jin Dawen, Cui Zhiyuan and other Confucian scholars. The literary genre form of the unified Silla period also began to diversify. On the basis of folk oral legends, historical literature and legendary literature were developed. With the development of foreign relations, there was a long story of \"Going to the Five Kingdoms\". In addition, there are also fables.",

The liberation novels of this period mainly have four themes: returning to their hometown, liquidating the evil of the Japanese emperor, the urgent reality of the North-South issue, and the chaotic situation after the liberation of irony. The Korean literary works of the 1950s mainly revealed the trauma caused by the Korean War to the people's material and spiritual. The Korean literature in the 1960s and 1970s mainly represented the understanding of the North-South issue, the social life brought about by peasant life, industrialization, urbanization, and the affluent life after economic development. Park Jung-li’s Land is the most famous novel of this period. Other representative works of this period include Cui Renqi's \"Plaza\", An Shouji's \"Northern Island\", Huang Yuying's \"Going to Miura\", and Wu Yuji's \"The River of Fire\". In the 1980s, Dahe’s novels were revived, and his masterpiece was Huang Jiying’s Zhang Jishan.

Hite Beer is Korea's largest beer producer. In 2005, Hite Beer and Zhenlu merged into the Hai Te Zhen Lu Group. Koreans drink very much, and they want to pour wine to each other to express friendship. To drink alcohol for others, be sure to hold the bottle with your right hand and your right hand with your left hand to show respect. Drinking with your left hand is considered rude. The recipient also has to hold the cup with both hands to show his gratitude. There is a big difference between the Chinese and the Chinese constantly renewing their drinks. Koreans do not like to drink wine, but like to drink after a cup. When the younger generation and the elders drink, the younger generation must first pour the wine to the elders. After the elders drink alcohol, they can drink alcohol. You can't face the elders while drinking, but turn your face to the left and drink.",

Tang’s Dong Dufu, which was set up to manage the original Goguryeo’s homeland, was originally managed by Xue Rengui. Later, the Tang Dynasty appointed Gaogouli Treasure Wang Gaozang as the governor of Liaodong Prefecture and the King of Korea. Because the treasure king supported the anti-Tang was exiled. Gao Dewu, the son of Treasure King, took over the Dudu government. Japanese scholar Hiroshi Hiroshi describes the demise of Goguryeo in his book The Study of Little Goguryeo. The descendants of the Goguryeo royal family established the revival power of Koguryo in the north of the Datong River in Liaodong and the Korean Peninsula. However, due to the lack of historical data, it is not recognized by the academic community. After the death of Goguryeo, Goguryeo’s swordsman was originally the king of the treasures of the treasures of the Han Dynasty in the land of Baekje. He tried to rebuild Goguryeo and was supported by the New Luo Wenwu Wang Jin Famin. However, due to internal disputes, the sword was murdered and An Sheng was placed in Silla. Silla gave An Sheng a piece of land and asked him to establish a report for Germany. In 683, the Silla King of God was annexed to Germany for fear of rebellion. An Sheng was given the \"Gold\" surname of the Silla royal family.",

The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence. The higher the probability of occurrence, the lower the uncertainty, the higher the uncertainty of the event, and the additional information is needed to reduce the uncertainty.

Events include the description of all movements, such as events, action events, and so on.

However, this facility has caused some controversy because it is very close to residential. The school has repeatedly stressed that the security system of the facilities is perfect and there will be no security problems. In 1999, Bill Gates donated $20 million to MIT to build a computer lab called the William H. Gates Building, designed by Frank Gehry. Although Microsoft has also donated money to the school, it is the first time Bill Gates has provided funds in a private reputation. Other well-known campus buildings include pressurized wind tunnels and boat model pools to test marine vessels or equipment models. MIT's wireless network covers the entire campus and covers an area of 870,000 square meters. The system was launched in 2005 and has nearly 3,000 connection points.",

          "context": "A course usually includes lectures, tutorials, weekly homework, and tests. Although many students think that dealing with heavy academics is like drinking water from a fire hydrant, the transfer rate of MIT's college students is similar to that of other research universities in the United States. Each fall semester course does not rank students, but only reports whether it passes or not, which reduces some of the pressure on students. If the student fails to pass, the name of the course will not appear in the semester grade report. However, in the spring semester, students will be rated A, B, C, etc. Those who fail to pass will also be recorded. In 1969, Margaret founded the University Student Research Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, providing a platform for them to work directly with faculty or researchers. Most college students are involved in the fight for credits or augmentation. Many students have indicated that this program will help them publish papers, apply for patents or start a business. In 1970, the then College Relations Minister Benson River Snyder published a book on hidden curriculum, criticizing MIT's education so that students tend to follow some unwritten rules. Students who know how to take advantage of the teaching system rather than have a solid foundation can get higher graduation results. For example, senior students in some student groups will develop course secrets, record the weekly homework and test answers for different courses, for the reference of the younger brothers and sisters. In Snyder's eyes, these small movements hinder the development of personal creativity and knowledge.",

The marginalized Department of Economics, Management, Politics, and Linguistics began to strive for the upper reaches, and attracted professors who were widely respected in the academic community to teach, and even started postgraduate courses.

This area has a large number of beautiful buildings since the Middle Ages, including Strasbourg Cathedral and Petite France, and was UNESCO in 1988. Listed as a World Heritage Site, this is the first time that a city has won this honor throughout the city centre. Strasbourg was called Argentatat in ancient times. The name comes from the Celtic language that originally lived here, but it has been used since the Romans occupied the area. It means the hills along the River Ill, extending the meaning of the riverside city. At the end of the 5th century, the Germans rebuilt the city and named it Strateburgum, which means the city on the road, because during the Germanic period, Strasbourg was located on the main road of the East and West across the Rhine. Strasbourg, the name of Strasbourg today, is the French language of the Germanic language. Burg in German means the castle.",

In 1685, Louis XIV announced the order of Fontainebleau, announcing the abolition of the 1598 Nantes decree. The official religious intolerance policy led many Protestants to be expelled from Strasbourg and Alsace. The Cathedral of Strasbourg was also handed over to the Roman Catholic Church from the Lutheran Church.

However, the French Revolution also abolished the free market status of Strasbourg. The radical Jacobin ruled the city with an iron fist until it was overthrown by Robespierre. Many churches and monasteries were either destroyed or severely damaged during this period. The cathedral lost hundreds of statues and proposed to dismantle the church spire because it undermines the principle of equality. The steeple of the church was preserved, but the citizens wore a Frigate cap. With the growth of industry and commerce, the city's population tripled in the 19th century to reach 150,000. During the Franco-Prussian War and the Battle of Strasbourg, the city was heavily shelled by the Prussian army. On August 24, 1870, the Museum of Fine Arts and the City Library were destroyed by fire. The City Library is located in the Gothic-style former Domingo Church, which houses exclusive collections of medieval manuscripts, rare Renaissance books and Roman artifacts. After the end of the war in 1871, according to the provisions of the Frankfurt Treaty, the city was incorporated into the newly formed German Empire and became part of the Alsace-Lorraine. During the German reign, Strasbourg was rebuilt and a new luxury city was built, including a new museum and a new library. Germany was defeated in the First World War and the city was reclaimed by France.",

As one of the academic disciplines, the origin of political philosophy in the West can be traced back to ancient Greece, when the city and the state adopted various forms of political organization, including monarchy, autocracy, aristocratic politics, oligarchic politics and democracy. According to the traditional view, the Athenian Socrates is the founder of political philosophy. Plato's book of the ideal country became a classic work of political philosophy, and was also absorbed by Aristotle. The political philosophy of the Romans was influenced by the Stoic School, and the Roman politician Cicero also wrote works on political philosophy. In China, Confucius, Mencius, Mozi, and Legalism, as well as India’s Kadiliye, tried to find ways to restore political unity and stability; the first three resorted to human goodness, and the legalist It advocates discipline against human beings. In India, Kautiriye also developed an argument similar to jurisprudence and Machiavelli. Like Greece, the ancient civilizations of China and India created many branches of thought in a unified culture. The philosophers in China found that they had to face the social and political disintegration at the time and tried to find a way to resolve the crisis of civilization.",

Like the development of Islamic thought, Catholicism also places the status of philosophy below theology. Perhaps the most influential political philosopher in the Middle Ages was Thomas Aquinas, who re-introduced Aristotle's work, which had long been ignored, when it was only preserved by Islam. Aquinas used these works as part of the political philosophy of the scholastic philosophy and became a work that dominated European political philosophy for centuries. However, the most influential works appeared at the end of this period, which is the monarchy that Marquisili wrote in 1532. His monarchy and Li Wei's theory of Roman history accurately analyzed the politics of the classical period and became the main source of modern political philosophy. In the Age of Enlightenment, many new problems have arisen in the new doctrine of human psychology, the other societies found in the Americas, and the demands of the political society. Many thinkers such as Thomas Hobbs, John Locke, Montesquieu And Jean-Jacques Rousseau have thought about these issues.",

The Norwegian King Haakon V took the throne in 1299. He chose Oslo as a city for coronation, and since then has carried out a series of urban construction work, including the expansion of St. Mary's Church and the construction of the new Akershus Castle. In 1308, Oslo was looted and burned by Erik Magnusson, the Duke of South Manlan. By 1314, the power center of the Kingdom of Norway was officially transferred to Oslo. During the medieval Black Death, the population of Oslo was reduced by about a third. In 1536, with the formation of the Confederacy of Norway and Denmark, Copenhagen became the capital of the Confederacy, the capital status of Oslo fell to the provincial capital, and economic development also stagnate. The same period of religious reform reduced the importance of the church as a factor of economic activity. Most churches and monasteries in Oslo became redundant and useless, and the subsequent wave of unemployment further exacerbated the decline of the city. In the siege of Oslo in Sweden in 1567, the Oslo citizens burned the city on their own, and then they carried out reconstruction work. Oslo has a good academic and educational atmosphere in the Middle Ages. The Oslo humanism of the time was a prolific academic circle. Due to their work, Oslo became the cultural center of Norway between 1580 and 1610.",

The newly established national administration laid the foundation for new economic growth, and the industrialization process that began in the 1840s provided a strong impetus. In the 19th century, Christiania expanded rapidly and many new public buildings began to be built – including the Oslo Palace, the Norwegian Parliament Building, and the National Theatre. A number of public buildings to the west of the Christiania built-up area belonged to the plan developed by architect Hans Lindsdale in 1838, in which Karl Johan Street will become the main axis, and the new city attracts many wealthy citizens. At the same time, the industry along the Aker River to the east of the city has developed rapidly, which has allowed workers to live in nearby areas as much as possible. This led to the social gap between the eastern and western parts of the city and became an important feature of the city since then. In the second half of the 19th century, Christiania built a new urban area for immigrants working in the factory. In 1854, the first railway station in Christiania was built. On January 1, 1878, other areas of Aker and 18,970 residents were also incorporated. The authorities hope to make adjustments to urban construction and social differences in different regions through administrative division adjustments, and introduce fire prevention regulations to more areas to reduce the occurrence of fires. In the 1980s and 1990s, urban construction work developed to a climax, and a large number of rented houses were built. In 1894, the city also built the first tram line. But the stock market crash of 1899 caused the process to come to an abrupt end, until 1910, when new construction work began.",

Wartime pragmatism allowed the recruitment of former Tsarist officers and police officers to the Red Army, which was reviewed and recruited by the special committee of Lev Glezarov; in the mid-August 1920, the Red Army’s former Tsarist personnel included 48,000 officers, 10,300 managers and 214,000 non-commissioned officers. . At the beginning of the civil war, the former Tsarist personnel accounted for 75% of the Red Army officers, employed as military experts, and occasionally held hostages to keep them loyal. At the end of the war in 1922, the former Tsarist personnel accounted for 83% of the Red Army division and military commanders.",

The Soviet offensive began on November 30, 1939—three months after World War II and the Soviet invasion of Poland, ending the Moscow Peace Agreement signed on March 13, 1940. The League of Nations determined that the war was illegal and expelled the membership of the Soviet Union on December 14, 1939. The Soviet army has three times the strength of the Finns, 30 times the plane and hundreds of times the tank. However, the Red Army was weakened in the great cleansing of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1937, and the morale and combat capabilities of the army were reduced before the outbreak of the war. More than 30,000 generals were executed or detained, many of which were of a very high rank, resulting in the lack of combat experience in the 1939 Red Army. Because of these factors, as well as the high degree of dedication and high morale of the Finnish army, Finland has been able to persever in the war of aggression that is longer than the Soviet Union expected; the Finnish army has caused the Red Army to suffer amazing losses in the first three or four months. At the same time, the losses suffered by myself are small. The war ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Agreement. Finland ceded 11% of the territory before the war and 30% of the economic assets to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union suffered heavy losses on the front line and its international reputation was hit hard. The Red Army did not complete their goal of completely conquering Finland, but fully conquered Lake Ladoga, Percega and Sara. Finland has preserved its sovereignty, increased its international reputation and boosted morale in the subsequent war.",

At this point, the second cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was completely broken. From March to September 1947, the Communist army was on the defensive, preferring to lose all the bases in the territory, but also to defend the northeast; the national army attacked the CCP's controlled areas and captured many cities in the CCP.

A spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council expressed serious concern over the incident and believed that this was a vicious incident that undermined the peaceful atmosphere across the Taiwan Strait. He strongly condemned the criminal actions of the Taiwan authorities and resolutely demanded that the Taiwan authorities quickly identify the situation, announce the truth, and severely punish the incident. By. In 1996, the first presidential election of the Republic of China was conducted. The People’s Republic of China targeted the southeastern seas and carried out ballistic missile tests. The Chinese National Army of the Republic of China entered a state of high readiness. The crisis was eased by the US Seventh Fleet entering the Taiwan Strait in the name of the passage. However, the CCP’s tacit understanding of the military was not broken. The scope of the PLA’s military activities extended to the central line of the Straits, which compressed the warning time of the Republic of China Air Force. At the time of the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Hu Jintao, the general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, put forward the idea of signing a peace agreement between the two sides of the strait. At that time, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party ignored it. However, after the second party rotation, President Ma Ying-jeou said that he did not rule out a peace agreement with China, but there is no timetable. It was re-submitted in October 2011, and later said that it would be signed by the referendum. However, this statement still triggers criticism from the pan-green camp in Taiwan. It is considered to be a one-sided surrender agreement for paving the way, which involves changing the status quo. However, the Taiwan people have not given him this power and lack the supervision and guarantee of the third party. The ally also questioned that the CCP was not reliable and ended up in vain. In the spring of 2014, the Sun Flower School was erupted, and follow-up negotiations between the two sides were blocked. In 2015, a cross-strait leaders meeting was held in Singapore, but the two sides did not issue a joint statement or sign an agreement. In 2016, Tsai Ing-wen was elected as the president, the DPP re-governed, and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait were once again deadlocked.",

It has been subjected to wars by warlords, Beiyang restoration forces, the struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and Japan’s invasion of China, which can be said to have been the Republic of China since 1912. From the year of governance to the year of 1949, it has been in war and turmoil. In the face of the unequal treaties signed during the Qing Dynasty, China, with its weak national power, has no peaceful and stable governance period to prove its ability to rule. The social malpractices have arisen, the people's lives are hard, the country is weak, and the government has no time to take care of the people's livelihood. However, during this period, the Republic of China successfully abolished all the unequal treaties signed by China since the Qing Dynasty, roughly unified the Chinese territory, and led China to win in the war against Japan and become a founding and permanent member of the United Nations. It has contributed a lot to the revival of China in the future. The Communist Party of China believes that during the period of the Republic of China, the working class, the peasant class and the urban petty bourgeoisie, which accounted for the vast majority of the Chinese population, regained their rights and land through revolutionary means and became the most direct people’s right to seek survival. The easiest way. The survival and development of the landlord class and the comprador class, especially the big landlord class and the big comprador class, are attached to imperialism. They represent China's most backward and reactionary production relations and hinder the development of China's productive forces. Its political representative is Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang right. All the warlords, bureaucrats, comprador classes, large landlord classes and some of the reactionary intellectual circles affiliated with them were regarded as enemies by the Chinese Communist Party during the Civil War.",

During the Kuomintang's establishment of the National Government to launch the Northern Expedition, the contradictions between the two parties intensified, leading to the announcement of the Qing Dynasty by the Central Commander of the National Revolutionary Army, Jiang Zhongzheng, in Nanjing on April 12, 1927. In July of the same year, the Wuhan National Government led by Wang Jingwei announced the sharing of the Communist Party. The two parties formally broke. On August 1, 1927, the Communist Party launched the Nanchang incident, began to arm the power, and successively established the Red Army of China's workers and peasants and several revolutionary base areas, and opposed the court of the Republic of China in Nanjing. In December 1928, after the completion of the Northern Expedition and the formal unification of China, the National Government had besieged the Communist Party’s base in the South five times since 1930. In 1934, in the fifth round of the encirclement war, the national army captured the Central Soviet Area where the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was located. The main force of the Chinese Workers and Peasants Red Army was forced to launch the Long March and arrived in northern Shaanxi in 1935. After the Xi'an Incident in December 1936, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party agreed to stop the civil war and reach a cooperation anti-Japanese agreement. The Chinese Workers and Peasants Red Army was incorporated into the National Revolutionary Army, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region under the Communist Party was nominally under the direct control of the National Government. After the outbreak of the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in 1937, the Nationalist Government pushed a large number of local warlords to the front line of the war, while Hu Zongnan and other central government troops surrounded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area; the Communist Party mainly relied on guerrilla warfare and established a large number of enemy bases. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have accused each other of being ineffective in the war and many military conflicts.",

The Communist Party named its armed forces as the People's Liberation Army. After three major battles, including Liaoshen, Xujing and Pingjin, the Communist Party gained military superiority in the Northeast and the North. By the beginning of 1949, it had controlled all the provinces north of the Yangtze River. On the other hand, the National Government ended its administration in 1947, enacted the Constitution, reorganized the National Government, which was governed by the party, into the Constitutional Republic of China, reorganized the National Revolutionary Army into a national army, and proposed financial reform measures such as the implementation of the Golden Coupon. The Chinese economy, which was weak after the war, tried to exchange reforms for social elites and the support of the middle class. However, the failure of the reforms made the Kuomintang people lose their hearts. In April 1949, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party held a ceasefire negotiation in Beiping but failed. The Chinese People's Liberation Army immediately launched the Battle of Dujiang, occupying the capital Nanjing and the largest city of Shanghai, and gradually seized most of China's territory. On October 1, the same year, the People's Republic of China was established in Beijing after the renaming, and as the national army retreated in the war, the government of the Republic of China retreated to Taiwan in December 1949. Since the retreat of Dachen Island in 1955, the effective rule of the Republic of China government has been limited to Taiwan’s Golden Horse and some South China Sea Islands. After 1950, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party still had several small-scale wars. By 1979, after the two sides ceased their own fires in 1979, they basically maintained the rule of separation in the Taiwan Strait. Even today, the exchanges and relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have greatly improved.",

However, it was in conflict with Chen Yuming, who was a constitutionalist, and finally triggered the June 16 Incident. After Sun Wen returned to Shanghai, he was weak and needed to rely on the support of outside forces. At this time, Adolf Abramovich’s flight to the Beiyang government failed, and contact with Wu Peifu was rejected. He arrived in Shanghai and met with Sun Wen. The two sides issued a joint declaration of Sun Wenyue and began the cooperation between the Chinese Kuomintang and the Soviet Union. The Communist Party of China, which is in the midst of fashion, has to listen to the Soviet Union on the premise of not having its own military power. It needs the support of the friendly party in the urban revolution, and it also follows the Soviet Union to carry out cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. After Chen Yuming was defeated by the multi-channel warlords, Sun Wen was greeted back to Guangzhou to establish the Grand Marshal House. With the assistance of the Soviet Union and the Communist International, the Kuomintang structure was reorganized and the Whampoa Military Academy was established. The Soviet Union also supported the military. The first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party reached a climax at this time. Members of the Communist Party of China even joined the Kuomintang in their personal capacity, and many students from the Whampoa Military Academy joined the CCP. However, after Sun Wen’s death, the Soviet Union used the Chinese Communist Party to split the Kuomintang into two parties. The power of the Kuomintang forces worried that the Kuomintang, which is supported and led by the Soviet Union and the Communist state, would dominate the party and government. The Communist Party of China and the Soviet Union’s adviser, Bao Luoting, took the party’s power in the front, and the revolutionary force was used as a reason to publish the Northern Expedition in the National Revolutionary Army, and distributed leaflets in the urban area of Guangzhou to oppose the Northern Expedition. In June, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China discussed the Northern Expedition and adopted a resolution against the unification of the Northern Expedition.",

During this period of easing, the CCP called it the second cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. After the Lugouqiao Incident on July 7, 1937, China and Japan entered a state of total war. On July 17, Jiang Zhong was speaking in Lushan, indicating China’s bottom line for Japan’s concession and its attitude toward preparing for a comprehensive war of resistance. From August 22 to August 25, Mao Zedong called the real task of the CCP in the Luochuan meeting. Regarding military issues, the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression will be a difficult and protracted war. The basic tasks of the Red Army are: creating base areas, restraining and destroying enemies, cooperating with friendly forces, preserving and expanding the Red Army, and striving for the Communist Party’s leadership over the national revolutionary war. The Red Army’s operational policy is an independent mountain guerrilla war. In September 1937, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ning Soviet government was reorganized into the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government directly under the jurisdiction of the National Government Administrative Office. About 40,000 Red Army troops in the Northern Shaanxi Region were reorganized into the Eighth Route Army of the National Revolutionary Army to cross the Yellow River and head to the North China battlefield; another 8,000 The guerrillas who remained in the eight southern provinces after the Red Army’s main long march were reorganized into the new Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang mainly engaged in frontal battles with the main forces of the Japanese army, and the CCP conducted guerrilla operations in the enemy-occupied areas. China and Japan have 22 large-scale battles and tens of thousands of small and medium-sized battles. Among them are the Ping-type campaigns in which the national army and a handful of Eighth Route Army generals cooperated without authorization. The CCP also has a separate battle against Japan, such as the Hundred Regiments. There have been many conflicts between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The most influential ones are the Huangqiao Campaign and the Southern Anhui Incident.",

In addition, the Observatory will also forecast the weather profile for the next 9 days. Whenever bad weather occurs, the Observatory will issue different weather warning signals in response to the situation to remind the public to take appropriate measures. Members of the public can also call to ask for weather services and call a specific hotline to listen to weather reports and weather warnings in effect. Ironically, in the 1920s and 1930s, the Hong Kong Government did not encourage the public to call the Observatory to inquire about the weather in the event of inclement weather. This would prevent the Observatory's telephone line from being busy. At least three times, the Government should appeal to members of the public not to fight in the wind. Call the Observatory. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Observatory also did not call the Observatory's words on tropical cyclone messages in the tropical cyclone warnings to avoid making the telephone lines busy and paying attention to the latest news of the radio to the public at certain times. Later, in 1985, the Observatory began to set up a telephone call to listen to the weather service. The staff of the Observatory had been busy listening to the telephone during the tropical cyclone. Therefore, there was no call for the public to call the Observatory during the tropical cyclone attack. .",

This wave of new policies has greatly enhanced the influence of trade unions, nationalized and expanded social welfare, more regulation of business, and increased taxation on commercial profits. With these policies, he established a new electoral structure composed of different groups for the Democratic Party, called the New Deal Alliance, which includes trade unions and minorities. In addition to the two elections of 1952 and 1956, the New Deal Alliance dominated American politics for decades, until 1968. After an overwhelming victory in the 1936 election, Roosevelt announced that he would expand the Supreme Court, which was in conflict with his New Deal plan. A fierce conflict broke out within the Democratic Party, and Roosevelt’s Vice President John Nans Ghana turned against him. Finally, the Republican and Conservative Democrats in the Congress formed an alliance, which together blocked almost all the legislative proposals in Roosevelt's next term. Roosevelt tried to start the Qing party because of the threat from the conservatives within the party, but in the end it was still unsuccessful.",

In the end, it’s not true that the Republican Congress was deadlocked and there was no progress. Truman took the opportunity to criticize them in the country for being useless. Then the 1948 presidential election showed a major reversal. Truman defeated Thomas Dewey and was re-elected, and the Democrats regained the Congress. However, many of Truman’s policies, such as the universal health care system, are still being blocked by conservatives in Congress. In 1952, General Dwight Eisenau defeated Illinois Governor Adelaide Stevenson and regained the White House for the Republican Party. Four years later, Eisenhower defeated Stevenson again.

Carter tried to deregulate the transportation, aviation, railway, finance, communications, and oil industries, thus abandoning the long-term New Deal's economic control policy. He consolidated the social welfare system and assigned a record number of women and minorities to important government departments and judge positions. He also enacted many environmental protection laws. In foreign affairs, Carter’s achievements include the David Camp and the Treaty of the Yom Kippur War, the Panama Canal Treaty, and the establishment of formal diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China, as well as strategic arms restrictions negotiations with the Soviet Union. In addition, Carter also puts a lot of emphasis on human rights and uses it as the main axis of foreign policy. Despite these efforts, Carter finally failed in the national health insurance plan or the tax system reform, and these were all promised during his campaign. At the same time, domestic inflation has also risen sharply. In foreign countries, the Iranian hostage crisis of more than one year has caused 52 Americans to be held hostage for 444 days, and Carter’s diplomatic and military rescues have also failed. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 also made the American public feel more and more vulnerable to Carter's incompetence and fragility, even though Carter had a boycott of the Moscow Olympics. In the 1980 US presidential election, Carter was able to run for re-election through the Democratic nominations conference, but in the end it was overwhelmingly defeated by Republican Lonna Reagan in November. Reagan included an overwhelming victory in 44 states. Carter only Win 6 states. At the same time, the Democratic Party also lost 12 Senate seats. This is the first time the Republican Party has regained control of the Senate since 1954. However, the House of Representatives still uses the Democratic Party as the majority.",

The Democrats have established a nationwide alliance based on the most supportive New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and border areas, but they still have little power in New England in the six northeastern states. Like the Jeffersonians, the Democratic Party strongly opposes the elite rule and banks of the nobility and appeals their public opinion to the people. By the 1820s, the right to vote had no restrictions on property of a certain size, so white males in almost all regions could participate in the voting. The Democratic Party is a complex political coalition supported by rural farmers from all over the country and from labor groups in urban areas. The main theme of the Democratic Party in the 1830s was to establish a stronger political party mechanism, oppose the state and the central bank, and oppose modernization policies that sacrifice taxpayers to achieve industrial development. Unlike the industrial vertical division of labor, the Democratic Party strongly supports the expansion of new agricultural land. One of the examples was the expulsion of Indians east of the Mississippi River and the acquisition of large tracts of land on the grounds of the Indian Migration Act after 1830.",

The private securities litigation reform law that reformed the judicial system was also passed under his veto power. The trade unions that have gradually lost their influence since the 1960s have found that their own influence on the Democratic Party has gradually declined. Despite the strong opposition of the trade unions, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade with Canada and Mexico in 1993. The agreement entered into force on January 1, 1994. When the Democratic Party gradually turned to the middle, some moderate or conservative Democrats began to emerge and also gained certain leadership and influence within the party. Some liberals and progressives feel that they have been isolated by the Democratic Party and believe that the Democratic Party no longer cares about the issue of the general people and the left. However, Clinton’s own scandal also affected the reputation of the Democratic Party to a certain extent.

In the 1848 election, a faction called the Freedom Party opposed the expansion of slavery and finally broke with the Democratic Party.

The Democratic Party’s leader in the Senate, Stephen Douglas from Illinois, in 1854, despite the strong opposition in the party, promoted the Kansas-Nebraska law and became one of the causes of the American civil war. At that time, political alliances, politicians, and voters' structures were greatly changed. New political issues and policies also emerged in large numbers. This period was called the Third Party. The Whig Party was completely disbanded at this time. While the Democratic Party continues to develop, many advocates of the abolitionist Democrats have joined the newly formed Republican Party.

On 8 March 2011, Azerbaijan claimed that an Armenian Defence Force sniper in the territory of Nagorny Karabakh had shot and killed the 9-year-old Fariz Badalov. Badalov’s death was condemned by some PACE members in a written declaration of No. 12591 and signed. However, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Nagorny Karabakh denied the allegation in a joint statement. According to the statement, the Armenian position is too far away from the village of Ottakaven, and it is impossible to use a sniper rifle to shoot people.

Six days later, Yerevan held a parade to join in solidarity. On February 20th, the People’s Representative of Karabakh, the Soviets, voted to transfer the area to Armenia by 110 votes to 17. This unprecedented action by the regional Soviets triggered tens of thousands of demonstrations in Stepanek and Yeerwin, respectively, but Moscow rejected the Armenian request. On February 22nd, when a large group of Azerbaijanis marched from the Agdam district to the Armenian town of Askeran, the first direct confrontation took place and the destruction was carried out along the way. The Azerbaijani confronted the police near Askerland and deteriorated into the Aslanan conflict, which led to the death of two Azerbaijanis, one of whom was reportedly killed by an Azerbaijani police officer. Fifty Armenian villagers were injured with an unknown number of Azerbaijanis and police. A large number of refugees left Armenia and Azerbaijan when violence began to occur against a small number of people in their respective regions. On November 29, 1989, the central government of the Soviet Union ended its rule of Nagorny Karabakh, and the area returned to Abyssin’s administration. However, the Soviet policy failed, and the Armenian Supreme Soviet and Nagorny Karabakh Parliament announced the unification of Nagorny Karabakh and Armenia. In 1989, Nagorno Karabakh had a population of 192,000. Of course, 76% of Armenians, 23% of Azerbaijanis, and a small number of Russians and Kurds. On November 26, 1991, Azerbaijan abolished the autonomous state of Nagorny Karabakh, re-adjusted the administrative division and placed the area under the direct control of Azerbaijan.",

Nagasaki Prefecture, where many cultures meet, has many different styles of architecture. The Dutch business hall in Hirado was built in 1609 and is a government-recognized historical site. At present, the Dutch merchant house in Pinghu is undergoing restoration works, and it is expected to reproduce the style of the 17th century. The Dongsan-hand and Namsan-hand areas in Nagasaki City are important traditional preserved areas for construction. The Goraba Park is home to many Western-style homes built in the late 19th century. The old Golaba house built in the 1860s is the oldest surviving wooden building in Japan's history. It was the residence of the British businessman Thomas Blake Goraba. There are also Western-style buildings in the Nagasaki City, including the old Nagasaki British Consulate and the old Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Nagasaki Branch. Some buildings in the settlement of foreigners in the Edo period have also been restored. There are also many Chinese-style buildings in Nagasaki. Chongfu Temple, Fuji Temple and Xingfu Temple are also known as Nagasaki Sanfu Temple. The first peak gate of the Chongfu Temple and the Daxiong Hall are Japanese national treasures. The eyeglass bridge was built by the Ming Dynasty, and it is known for its unique appearance. Nagasaki City now has Nagasaki Newland Chinatown and Confucius Temple, one of the three largest Chinese streets in Japan. The night view of Nagasaki City is highly rated, and it is ranked as the newest three night city in Japan with Sapporo City and Kobe City. The Shimabara Peninsula area was included in the Geopark due to frequent volcanic activity. The volcanic activity also makes Shimabara Onsen one of the main hot spring resorts in Nagasaki Prefecture. Located in the suburbs of Sasebo, Huis Ten Bosch is a theme park that mimics the Dutch city style. It opened in 1992 and is the largest theme park in Japan. In recent years, Huis Ten Bosch has newly established a game museum, a hotel fully serviced by robots, medical examination facilities, night scenes and other entertainment facilities, and the number of tourists has also increased significantly.",

In the Edo period, Nagasaki Prefecture is divided into one shogunate, six squats, and five collars. The situation is extremely complicated. After the Okamoto Big Eight incident in 1612, Tokugawa Ieyasu issued a ban on education and severely suppressed the Catholic Church. In the early days of the Edo period, both Hirado and Nagasaki were trade bases licensed by the shogunate. In 1637, the island was destroyed by the island. The shogunate characterized the incident as a glimpse of the Catholics, tightened the suppression of the Catholic Church, and began to implement the policy of locking the country. In 1641, the shogunate expelled the Portuguese who lived in Nagasaki, and moved the Dutch merchant house in Hiroshi to Nagasaki, where the shogunate's permission to trade with the West was concentrated in Nagasaki. On the other hand, there are still many Catholic believers in the Nagasaki area who believe in Catholicism in private. The proportion of Catholic believers in Nagasaki Prefecture is still significantly higher than the Japanese average. In the era of the country, Zong’s horse was the only place in Japan in the Edo period to obtain the permission of the shogunate and trade on the Korean peninsula. In addition, Nagasaki is Japan’s stronghold for trade between the West and China, so there are two official licenses in Nagasaki Prefecture. Trade base. Due to the importance of Nagasaki, it was listed as a direct jurisdiction by the Shogunate. The Dutch in Nagasaki were concentrated in the island at that time, so that they could be monitored by the shogunate and isolated from the Japanese. And in the Yuan Lu period, the Chinese who originally allowed diaspora also began to be concentrated in the Tang Dynasty housing. The population of Nagasaki in the Yuan Lu period was about 60,000, of which 10,000 were Chinese. Nagasaki in the Edo period was not only a trade center, but also a window for Western culture and academics to flow into Japan. In comparison with Nagasaki, Hirado, Shimabara and other places were in Shimomachi in the Edo period, but the scale was relatively small. In 1792, the Shimabara volcano erupted and local agriculture was severely hit.",

For the period of political reform that was in the process of non-commonization throughout Europe, the turmoil in the Southern Confederation was seen by the European Community as an obstacle to the reconstruction of the new order, so the war was actively mediated.

In particular, the Mukhs in Boch are more worried about the persecution of the Serbs. So the Boch government also embarked on the road to the Union. In October 1991, the Boch Congress passed a declaration of sovereignty, which implied independence in the declaration. The Serbian parliamentarians withdrew from the protest and claimed that the declaration was illegal. The Macedonian side, together with the Boch government, believes that if it continues to remain in the southern federation, it is highly likely to be controlled by Serbia, so it also operates independently. On September 8, 1991, the Republic of Macedonia held an independent referendum, 95% of which voted for Macedonia's independence from the South. On November 20th, Macedonia issued a new constitution and officially declared independence. Because there are not many Serb residents, there is no conflict with Serbia’s interests. Both also want to cooperate to solve the problem of Albanian separatism in each other, and both the United States and the European Union. With active involvement, Macedonia has thus become a rare and independent country among the republics.

On June 28, Stalin set up a statement for the Communist Party of East Asia, which was used to control the Communist Party of Eastern Europe, accusing Dito of the wrong political line and expelling Yugoslavia from the Communist Intelligence Bureau, in order to set off the guilt of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and make Dito lose power. However, because this day is a commemorative day in the history of Yugoslavia's defense against foreign enemies, it has made the Yugoslav people more resistant to the Soviet chauvinistic threat. Dito then gave a speech on July 21, countering the accusations of the Communist Intelligence Agency and publishing round-trip letters from the two countries. Although the Soviet Union convened other Eastern group countries to blame, Dito won, and its position was stable. It is widely supported by the Central Committee and is more supported by the Yugoslav people. The breakup between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia was the first split of the socialist camp. For the latter’s national policy and the influence of Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia embarked on an open socialist system and a diplomatic moderate line. The latter was also agitated, which contributed to the later Eastern Europe. The anti-Soviet movement that broke out in various countries and the political liquidation of Dito.",

Gene transfer from the same species and across species is included to produce improved or new organisms. New genetic material can be inserted into the host genome by isolating and replicating the desired genetic material using molecular replication techniques to produce DNA sequences, or by synthesizing DNA and then inserting into the host organism. Nucleases can be used to remove or knock out genes. Gene targeting is a different technique for using homologous recombination to alter endogenous genes, and can be used to delete genes, remove exons, add genes, or introduce point mutations. An organism produced by genetic engineering is considered to be a genetically transformed organism. The first gene-transforming organism was a bacterium produced in 1973 and a genetically-transferred mouse in 1974. Insulin-producing bacteria were commercialized in 1982, and genetically modified foods have been sold since 1994. GloFish, the first genetically engineered organism designed as a pet, was first sold in the United States in December 2003. Genetic engineering techniques have been applied in many fields, including research, agriculture, industrial biotechnology, and medicine. Enzymes for laundry detergents and drugs such as insulin and human growth hormone are now produced in gene transfer cells, experimental gene transfer cell lines and gene transfer animals such as mice or zebrafish are being used for research purposes, and genes The transfer crop has been commercialized.",

This involves the use of recombinant nucleic acid technology to form new combinations of heritable genetic material, which are then directly incorporated into the material by indirect or by microinjection, bulk injection and microencapsulation techniques. Genetic engineering typically does not include traditional animal and plant breeding, in vitro fertilization, multiple sports, artificial mutagenesis, and cell fusion techniques, as recombinant nucleic acids or genetically modified organisms are not used in the process. However, the European Union also broadly defines genetic engineering as including selective breeding and other means of manual selection. Replication and stem cell technology, although not considered to be genetic engineering, are also closely related to genetic engineering, in which genetic engineering can be used.

It is synonymous with genetic engineering, and in the United States, the term genetic modification can also refer to conventional breeding methods. Canada's regulatory system is based on whether the product has novel characteristics, regardless of the source. In other words, if the product carries some traits that were not previously found in the species, it is regulated to a genetic modification, whether it is produced using traditional breeding methods or genetic engineering. In the scientific community, the term genetic engineering is not commonly used. Instead, more specific terms, such as gene transfer, are used.",

It is the most used artificial civil construction material in the world and is widely used in houses, bridges, highways and runways. Structures such as retaining walls, dikes, culverts, dams, water tanks, water towers, oil tanks, channels, ditches, wharves, breakwaters, military engineering, nuclear power plants, etc. Remains like concrete were unearthed in the Near East of the Nabatean and Bedouin in 6500 BC. The remains of concrete in the Dadiwan culture of China were unearthed, but it was nearly 3,500 years later than the Near East. In the ancient West, the Romans used volcanic ash to mix lime and sand into natural concrete. Natural concrete has strong cohesive strength, strong durability, imperviousness and other characteristics, which has been widely used in Rome, which has greatly promoted the development of Roman civil engineering structures, and the breakthroughs in the span of arches and domes have resulted in a large number of Large public civil buildings that people talk about. In the first century BC, natural civil engineering almost completely rejected stone in the vault structure.",

Political activities focus on securing resources that create bottlenecks. Political economy regards production as the central activity of the economy and regards labor as the ultimate bottleneck of government behavior. The government must use existing labor resources to meet demand and have sufficient capital to ensure that labor is effective. In Adam Smith's theory of national wealth, the basic formula of political economy is expressed as: capital-investment-consumption=surplus or deficit capital is a function of labor as a parameter. Investment is the capital needed for production, and consumption is the use of the product. If the state has a fiscal surplus, it will purchase materials, invest or consume. If the total amount of state investment and consumption is greater than its output, there will be a fiscal deficit, then it must be sold out of assets or borrowed to balance. Research on production focuses on the broad interaction between capital and labor. Because labor must rely on capital, with certain skills and money.",

In a narrow sense, it usually refers to a way of transporting a vehicle with wheelsets along a railway track to achieve the purpose of transporting passengers or cargo. The generalized railway transportation also includes maglev trains, cable cars, ropeways, etc., which are not in the form of wheels, but still operate along specific tracks. In mainland China, rail transit generally refers to urban rail transit and intercity rail transit. According to the national standard of urban rail transit technical regulations of the People's Republic of China, urban rail transit is defined as: urban public passenger transport system using dedicated orbital guidance, including subway system, light rail system, monorail system, tram, maglev system, automatic guidance Track system, city fast track system. Its English translation is urban rail transit. Rail transport is one of the most convenient ways of land transportation. The rails provide a very smooth and rigid medium for the wheels of the train to roll with minimal friction. The people above will feel more comfortable and save energy. If properly configured, rail transport can save five to seventy percent of energy when carrying the same weight than road transport. Moreover, the rails can evenly distribute the weight of the train, which greatly increases the load capacity of the train. And safe and comfortable. The average death rate per 100 million passengers is one-tenth to one-hundredth of the death toll from road traffic accidents, making it the safest mode of transportation.",

In the early days, Netease's main business was the sale of mail system software license. In 1998, 163.com was launched as a free web mail service for domain names. 163 was the most common dial-up number of China Telecom at that time. It is generally considered to be a popular and easy-to-remember name. It has played an important role in the success of Netease Web Services. Later, Netease followed Sina and Sohu to launch an portal service, often referred to as the three major portals. The network was easy to be listed on NASDAQ in the United States in 2000. The Internet bubble burst in 2001, which had a great impact on Netease, and the stock price once fell below one dollar. At the same time, due to alleged financial fraud, Netease shares were suspended from the Nasdaq stock market from July 27, 2001 to January 2, 2002. After the financial crisis, NetEase successfully developed new services including wireless value-added and online games. At the end of 2001, Netease launched the first self-developed large-scale online role-playing game, Westward Online, which is one of the earliest large-scale online games in mainland China. Later, on the basis of the original work, the Westward Online II was developed. It was officially launched on August 15, 2002 and became the first domestically produced online game successfully operated. On September 5, 2013, the Westward Online II was upgraded to New Westward Journey 2. At present, the number of registered users of the Westward Journey 2 brand is nearly 200 million, and the highest online product price exceeds 1.26 million. On September 17, 2015, the Westward Journey Mobile Games platform beta test, the number of registered players in a month exceeded 5 million, with excellent reputation and good quality for a long time in the forefront of the major rankings. In recent years, NetEase's Fantasy Westward Journey has also triggered a wave of online games, but some parents questioned that online games made teenagers addicted to it.",

In 1948, Xia Nong, who worked at Bell Labs at the time, published the mathematical principles of the paper communication. This iconic paper created a mathematical theory method for analyzing communication systems, namely information theory. Information theory allows us to extrapolate the capacity based on the channel's bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio characteristics. In the era of paper publication, telecommunications systems are mainly based on analog circuits. Since then, with the proliferation of digital integrated circuits, the design of telecommunication systems can make full use of the theoretical guidance of information theory to improve performance. As a result, digital signal processing has also become a new field. The basic elements that make up a communication system include transmitters, channels, and receivers. The transmitter is responsible for encoding or converting the information into a signal suitable for transmission. The signal is transmitted to the receiver through the channel. During the transmission process, the signal is inevitably changed due to the presence of noise. The receiver side attempts to apply the appropriate decoding means to recover the information from the degraded signal. An important indicator for describing a channel is bandwidth. The structure of the communication system can be point-to-point or point-to-multipoint, and broadcasting is a special form of point-to-multipoint propagation.",

          "context": "Drug abuse is the second most common risk factor for suicide after derepression and bipolar disorder. Chronic drug misuse is associated with acute poisoning. If the grief of a person is combined, such as a bereavement, the risk will increase further. At the same time, drug misuse is associated with mental disorders. Most people suffer from sedative sleeping pills when they commit suicide, and 15% to 61% of them have alcohol problems. Countries with higher alcohol use rates and higher density bars often have higher suicide rates, and this connection is mainly related to the use of spirits and not to all alcohol use. About 2.2–3.4% of people who had been treated for alcohol abuse at some point in their lives died of suicide. Alcoholics with suicide attempts are usually male, older and have attempted suicide in the past. 3 to 35% of deaths from heroin use are due to suicide. The misuse of cocaine and methamphetamine is highly associated with suicide. People who use cocaine have the highest risk during the withdrawal period. People who use inhalers also have a higher risk. About 20% of them have attempted suicide at some point in time, while more than 65% have considered suicide. Smoking is associated with suicide risk, and there is very little evidence of the cause of this connection; however, it is assumed that people who are prone to smoking also have suicidal tendencies, and the health problems caused by smoking also make people want to end their lives and smoke. Affects brain chemistry and causes suicidal tendencies. Cannabis does not seem to increase this risk alone.",

          "context": "A range of mental states can increase the risk of suicide, including: despair, loss of life, depression, and anxiety. Poor problem-solving skills, loss of past abilities, and impulsive emotions all play a role in suicide risk. In the elderly population, the idea that you feel that you are the burden of others also plays an important role in suicide. Recent life pressures, such as the loss of a family member or friend, unemployment, social isolation, etc., can lead to increased risk. And those who have never stepped into the marriage hall are at higher risk of suicide. Religion may reduce the risk of suicide. This is because many religions have a negative stance on suicide, and on the other hand, because religious beliefs may make people strengthen their connections. Muslims have a lower suicide rate than other religious groups. Some people may shun bullying or discrimination by suicide. Sexual abuse experienced in childhood and experience living in foster homes are risk factors for suicide. Sexual abuse is considered to account for about 20% of the overall risk. Evolutionary psychology explains suicide as it may improve overall fitness. If someone is unable to give birth again and continues to devour the resources of the family during his or her survival, he/she may choose to commit suicide and may improve the overall fitness. One objection to this view is that healthy young people who choose to commit suicide to end their lives do not necessarily improve overall fitness. Adapting to a completely different original environment may be quite different from adapting to the current environment. Poverty is also linked to the risk of suicide. The widening gap between the rich and the poor is even more likely to increase the risk of suicide. More than 200,000 farmers in India have chosen suicide since 1997, partly because of debt. The risk of suicide in rural China is three times higher than the risk of suicide in urban areas, in part because the economy in this part of the country is still difficult.",

In some Eskimo cultures, this practice is a respectable, courageous, and intelligent act. The Lushan Festival test is also based on these principles. A suicide attack is a political act by an attacker who violently attacks others by sacrificing one's own life. In this way, some human bombs acquire the identity of the martyrs. The Shenfeng Special Forces complete the mission on the basis of pursuing a lofty career or moral obligation. Suicide after murder refers to a person committing suicide within a week after murdering others. Collective suicide usually refers to the suicide of a suicide member who commits suicide due to peer pressure when surrendering to a leader. Collective suicide even includes the situation of only two people, and this phenomenon is usually regarded as a suicide agreement. In the inability to endure the suffering of life, in order to alleviate the pain, some people will choose to commit suicide to obtain relief.

However, it is generally believed that this is due to the interaction of behavioral factors, social environmental factors and spiritual factors. Low levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factors are directly related to suicide and are indirectly related to major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. A necropsy study found a decrease in BDNF in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, regardless of whether the deceased had a mental illness. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter in the brain that is thought to be low in the suicide population. On the one hand, it has been found that the level of 5-HT2A receptors in the human body has increased after death. Other evidence includes a decrease in the levels of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in cerebrospinal fluid. But the direct evidence related to this is difficult to collect. Epigenetics is a science that studies changes in the level of gene expression caused by environmental factors that do not alter the sequence of a DNA gene, and it is also thought to play a role in determining the risk of suicide.",

Although the psychological crisis intervention hotline is more common, there is little evidence to prove or refute their effectiveness. For young people who have recently considered suicide, cognitive behavioral therapy seems to be an effective improvement. Economic development can reduce suicide rates by reducing poverty. Strengthening social connections between people, especially the elderly, can also have a certain effect. In the screening process for the general population, there is very little data showing how this screening works to reduce the final suicide rate.

In ancient Rome, although suicide was initially licensed, it was considered a crime against the state in the future because of its economic costs. The punishment of the suicide group by a criminal law enacted by Louis XIV in France in 1670 is even more cruel: the body of the deceased will be dragged into the urban streets, the land will be upside down and then thrown into the garbage. In addition, all of this person’s property will also be confiscated. In the long river of history, the suicide attempted Catholics will be slain, and the suicide-dead people will be buried outside the sacred cemetery. In the United Kingdom in the late 19th century, attempted suicide was equated with attempted murder, and the parties could be sentenced to death. In Europe in the 19th century, the cause of suicide was changed from the initial sin to the insanity.",

In the doctrine of Catholicism, the debate on this is mainly based on the fact that the Ten Commandments cannot kill one, and the blessings of life-based blessings, which cannot be abandoned. They believe that suicide is a violation of the natural order, and the Lord’s overall global The plan does not match. But people believe that mental illness or extreme fear reduces the sense of responsibility of suicides. The opposite statement includes: The sixth, more accurate translation of the Ten Commandments should be non-murderable, and not necessarily applicable to the parties themselves; the Lord gives the human will the freedom; the self-deprivation of one's own life is not necessarily the cause The degree of healing of a disease that violates the will of the Lord is high; in the biblical account, some of the followers of the Lord have not been tragically condemned after committing suicide. Judaism advocates the importance of paying attention to the value of this life. Therefore, suicide is tantamount to denying the Lord's good deeds in the world. Moreover, in extreme cases, when Jews face either being killed or apostasy, and there is no other choice, they will commit suicide or collective suicide. There is even a prayer in the Jewish prayers in a cold way. Remind those who are knives around their necks and those who dedicate their lives to the Lord in a way that is dead. Different Jewish institutions have different views on this behavior. Some people think that this behavior is a model of heroic martyrdom. Some people think that they should not expect to gain the reputation of martyrdom in the form of suicide.",

Since 468, Li Changren and Li Shuxian's brothers have boycotted the Liu Song court according to the state. At that time, the Song and Ming emperors were competing with the Northern Wei Dynasty for the Shandong and Huaibei regions, unable to conquer the state. They had to admit Li Changren's name and maintain the nominal rule of Liu and Song. In 471, a new Yuezhou was established at the junction of Jiaozhou and Guangzhou to defend the Li brothers. The Li brothers are likely to have the ancestry of the Yi ethnic group. Their separation in Jiaozhou has been maintained until 485 years before they were flattened by Qi Wudi. The monks are mainly scattered in the valleys of Sichuan and Hanzhong, and overlap with the distribution area of the monks. At that time, the monks and the Xia people were quite rented, indicating that the trend of their household registration and Huahua was heavier. Liu Song’s normal strength is about 20,000 to 300,000. When the limit is mobilized, there may be 400,000. However, when Liu Song was conquered in the north of Huai River, it was limited by the logistics supply, and only 50,000 or 60,000 troops could be launched, making the Northern Expedition often fail. In the early period of the Liu and Song Dynasties, the Beifu soldiers became the main source of the Central Army and Jingzhou and the northern Xuzhou Fangzhen. At this time, they were still dominated by the world military system. The rise of the middle-class Jingyi soldiers gradually gained certain advantages. Scholar Tian Yuqing believed that: Beifu Force Day The decline, the strength of Jing Jing, is two aspects of the same historical process. At this time, the world's military system declined, and the main force of the army was gradually replaced by the system of recruiting and conscription. In particular, the system of recruiting troops from the recruiting tribe became the elite core of the army in the late Song Dynasty. For example, the Qingqi Haozu, who was in exile in the south after 469, was recruited by Xiao Daocheng as the official and ministerial song, and became the main force of Xiao Daocheng's Qi Yi Song. Some scholars call this force group Huaiyin Group, and some call it Qingxu Group.",

Yilong is the emperor, and is the Emperor Wen of the Song Dynasty. In 426, Emperor Wen of the Song Dynasty removed the powers of Xu Junzhi and others. After he reigned for 30 years, he made great efforts to improve his work, knowing people and doing good deeds, and promoting ruling and clarifying the rule of law. The national production economy was greatly promoted, and it was called the rule of Yuanjia. The model of governing the world. Since 430 years, Emperor Wen of the Song Dynasty for the first time in the Northern Expedition, to the 50,000 Song Army led by Yan, successfully occupied Luoyang and other places in Henan. However, due to the lack of military power and the excessive command of Emperor Wen, the Northern Wei Dynasty forced the retreat of the tens of thousands of troops of the Song Army and reoccupied Henan in 431. In 436, the famous Tan Daoji was dispelled by the Song Wendi suspicion, and the Southern Song Dynasty lost the generals who could balance with the Northern Wei Dynasty. When the Northern Wei Dynasty took place in 445-446, the Southern Song Dynasty did not have an immediate Northern Expedition. By 445 years, when the Northern Wei Dynasty’s enemies were softly ruined, they began to launch several small-scale south levies. The two sides saw and saw in Huainan. In the 27th year of Yuanjia, Song Wendi sent troops to the south of the Northern Wei Dynasty, but was taken by the Northern Wei Dynasty. The rate of the Taiwu Emperor's Tuoba Institute was defeated by 600,000 troops, and 600,000 Wei Junjun led the troops to the south and threatened Jiankang. When Wei Jun passed by, he robbed and burned, and the loss of the Jianghuai area was heavy and the depression was weak. The rule of Yuanjia declined. In 452, Emperor Wen of the Song Dynasty took the opportunity to attack the Tuoba, and sent troops to carry out the third Northern Expedition, but still failed to return. After that, Liu Song could not do anything else, and he was destined to gradually withdraw from the national defense line in the future. In 453 AD, Song Wendi’s eldest son Liu Wei had a witchcraft incident, and his uncle was in the throne. His third brother Liu Jun’s uprising attacked Liu Wei and won the support of the military and towns of all parties. So Liu Wei was in Taicheng and Liu Jun became an emperor.

The population controlled by the world has some songs, hackers, and slaves. It cannot be freed without redemption or confession. Due to the decline of the large family system in the Southern Dynasties, the trilogy was gradually controlled by the state. The source of the hacker is the government's granting and private temptation according to official products. The main source of slaves is the bankrupt farmers or the displaced people, who are the private property of the landlord and can therefore be mortgaged or bought or sold. In order to prevent escape, the slaves were all smashed. The slaves can be transformed into the landlord's hackers and state soldiers by means of swearing for the guests and sending slaves to the soldiers. The peasant farmers were an important force in agricultural production at that time. They paid rents, miscellaneous taxes, servitude and military service to the court, which caused many farmers to go bankrupt and become exiles and hackers of the world. Liu Song implemented the world military system since the Three Kingdoms, and the soldiers have been soldiers for generations. Usually they still need to pay rent. Because the handicraft industry is very scarce, the government has strict control over the miscellaneous households or the hundred workers. After the workers are recruited from the private sector to the official workshops, they are working with the criminals assigned to the workshops. They work all year round and come together for generations. If the world and the bureaucrats occupy 100 workers, they are often punished. The Jiangnan society was transformed from a large family system to a small family in the late Jin and Song Dynasties. There were seven or eight in the same family and different occupations, and they ignored each other. This is because after the development of the clan, the families are different from each other. If there is no common foreigner, it is easy to separate; the taxation method of the court is not beneficial to the big family system.",

Afterwards, Xiao Daocheng took over the status of Liu Wei and rose to one of the four nobles along with the prime minister Yuan Yu.

In the forty-three years, the two great armies of the two countries repeatedly crossed the border, but they repeatedly lost and lost. The two sides could not stabilize the occupied land for a long time, so they maintained For more than 40 years, the situation has been evenly matched. Until 466, Liu Songshan and Huaibei towns, Xue Andu, Cui Daogu and others, sought help from the Northern Wei Dynasty because they were afraid of the self-reliant Song Mingdi to attack them. The Northern Wei Dynasty sent more than 50,000 troops to defeat all the towns of Shandong and Huaibei in four years after defeating Song Ming Emperor's Northern Expeditionary Zhang Yong. Liu Song was forced to border the Huaihe River and the Northern Wei Dynasty. Although the Song and Ming dynasties were unwilling, they repeatedly sent Shen Yuzhi and others to the north, but since then the border between the Southern and Northern Weihe Rivers has been roughly fixed.

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in 1937, Kunming became the rear of the anti-Japanese war. Many schools, factories, banks, trade names and refugees in the field moved to Kunming. In 1937, the population of Kunming was more than 140,000. By 1945, the population had increased to more than 250,000. The Yunnan-Burma Highway built in 1938 and the China-India hump route made Kunming become the main channel for China's international assistance during the Anti-Japanese War and the transfer of materials to the transit stations across the country. The city was driven by traffic factors and quickly modernized. Urban development has far-reaching implications. From 1941 to 1942, the Flying Tigers used Kunming as their base to fight against Japan.

Until 1966, this meter-rail railway has always been the main channel for Kunming to connect with the outside world. Kunming has also become the only provincial capital city in China that has no domestic trains and is known as one of Yunnan's eighteen strangers. The Kunhe Railway is currently the only rice-rail railway in China. The starting point is Kunming North Station, which is located in the northern part of Kunming City. It used to have a train every day to the estuary of the Sino-Vietnamese border. There are two trains a week to Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam. At present, the railway is mainly freight, and passenger transportation has basically stopped. Only the suburban trains of Wangjiaying via Kunming North to Shizui are available, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The morning train departs from Kunming North Railway Station and goes to Wangjiaying. Then Wangjiaying passes through Kunming North to Shizui and then returns to Kunming North Station. The train in the afternoon is only from Kunming North to Wangjiaying. After 1966, several railways from Kunming to other provinces were opened to traffic, including Guikun Railway, Chengkun Railway, Neijiang Railway, Nankun Railway, etc. In addition, a number of railways in the province, such as Guangtong to Dali, were built. Kunming to Kunyu Railway in Yuxi. It will be the end of the Pan-Asia Railway South Road in the future. In 2010, the Shanghai-Kunming Passenger Dedicated Line and the Yunnan-Guizhou Railway, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, started construction. Yunnan is expected to enter the high-speed rail era. On the night of March 1, 2014, a terrorist attack by Xinjiang independence elements occurred in Kunming Station. From 2009 to 2010, according to the website of the Ministry of Media and Commerce, in 2013, a 50-kilometer-long ring-dragon train will be opened, but as of January 2015, there has been no news of the opening of the train. It is not known when it will be opened.",

For noise and safety reasons, the launch site was chosen away from where humans live. Most of the space launch sites were transformed from the missile experimental range, and their components and functions were basically the same. The launch is usually limited by a certain launch window. These windows depend on the position of the celestial body and the orbit relative to the launch site. The most influential is often the rotation of the earth. Once launched, the orbit is usually in a relatively fixed plane that is at a fixed angle to the Earth's axis, and the Earth rotates on this orbit. The launch pad is a fixed structure for transmitting the aircraft. It usually includes a tower and a flame trench. It is surrounded by erected, fueled, and stable launch vehicles. The International Air Transport Association defines the Carmen line at a height of 100 kilometers, above which space is space. The rocket is the only viable means of reaching space today. Conventional aircraft engines cannot achieve space that lacks oxygen. The rocket engine discharges the propellant to provide forward thrust, which produces sufficient acceleration to enter the orbit.

          "context": "Scientific methods refer to a set of techniques used to examine natural phenomena, acquire new knowledge, or modify and integrate previously acquired knowledge. In order to be scientific, this approach must be based on collecting observable, empirical, measurable evidence and adhering to clear principles of reasoning. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary is defined as follows: the scientific method is a continuous process. Usually, the initial step is to carefully observe nature. People are born with a habit of picking three questions and four. They often think about the surrounding phenomenon. Some strange questions were made, and some hypotheses were developed to explain them. The best hypothesis leads to predictions that can be tested by multiple tests. Based on the results of the test, the hypothesis being examined may need to be improved or resolutely rejected. This whole cycle, from forecasting, testing to improvement, may be repeated many times, or even repeated indefinitely, until the hypothesis is improved to give predictions that match the test data. Then, a scientific theory can be announced. . The scientific approach involves many steps. First, you need to observe nature and ask meaningful questions about natural phenomena, and then come up with hypotheses to explain natural phenomena. Then design experiments to test these hypotheses and check whether the predictions given from these hypotheses are correct. In order to prevent errors or misunderstandings during the experiment, these steps must be repeatable. Before a hypothesis is widely accepted by the academic community, it must first be compared with the experimental data in a sensible way through the rigorous verification of scientific methods. This hypothesis can only be accepted by the academic community when the theoretical results and the experimental data are consistent with each other. Theories involving a wide range of academic fields may be combined with many independently introduced hypotheses that are consistent and complementary. Through the theory of rigorous testing, you can touch the analogy to help form a new hypothesis, or set the context of other hypotheses. In order to reduce the chances of obtaining biased results, scientific research is usually more objective and better. All measurement data and experimental procedures must be documented in detail, archived in a secure database, and shared by appropriate scholars. In this way, appropriate scholars can check carefully and check the results by copying experiments. This type of behavior, called full disclosure, allows for the establishment of statistical confidence in these data.",

Heilongjiang is an important equipment manufacturing, energy industry and agricultural base in China. The industrial sectors are mainly machinery, energy, food and pharmaceutical industries; the total grain output and commodity grain transfer volume rank first in the country. The residents of Heilongjiang in the Shang and Zhou Dynasties were Sushen tribes, and they made a living by hunting. According to historical records, they had tribute bows and arrows to Zhou Chengwang. The Han Dynasty is a national history book that is inhabited here. It is known as a monk. It can be used for agriculture, but it is also hunting. It once tribute to the prey of Wei Guo in the Three Kingdoms. This period is the beginning of the establishment of Heilongjiang. In the 2nd century BC, Fuyu was established and became the first state power in the history of Heilongjiang, under the jurisdiction of Xuanzang County. The people here in the Southern and Northern Dynasties were called Beji. During the Sui Dynasty, the southeastern part of the Heilongjiang River Basin was the living area of the Ministry of Health, and the west was the living area of the Department of Health. Both Yu and Shi Wei maintain a tribute relationship with the cockroach. Some documents in the Tang Dynasty mentioned 靺鞨, many tribes, and black otters living in the Heilongjiang River basin. In the Tang Dynasty, the government and the state have been set up in the Heilongjiang River Basin, and bureaucrats have been appointed to exercise jurisdiction.

Although from the perspective of science fiction history, there is no definition standard that can be recognized by all researchers. Some examples for reference are: science fiction is a work that describes the influence of science in science or imagination on humans; science fiction is a work that depicts objects in an unknown category. Although the above definitions are different in angles, there are always some words in the definition of science fiction, such as fantasy, future, technology, human beings, and change. As can be seen from these keywords, the scope of science fiction is always closely related to human curiosity and curiosity. One of the world's shortest science fiction novels sung in sci-fi enthusiasts is this: the last person on earth sat in the room. At this moment, a knock was heard. It can be said that this is more general than the precise definition of science fiction. The famous American literary critic Ihab Hassan once said: Science fiction may be philosophically naive, morally simple, aesthetically subjective, or rough, but its best aspect In terms of it, it seems to touch the nerve center of the collective dream of mankind, freeing up some of the illusions hidden in our human machine. In terms of philosophical theme, science fiction and human myths and legends have similar spiritual foundations, namely, the interpretation of the relationship between human beings and the universe, and the concern and speculation of the future destiny of human society. In the literary lineage, the romantic literary tradition should be the earliest literary matrix of science fiction. Early science fiction often had traces of horror, adventure, or fantasy. Moreover, the relationship between mystery novels and Gothic novels is the closest to science fiction. Many early works and even some of today's works have the above elements, which are difficult to distinguish strictly.

Verne's work inherited all the characteristics of adventure novels in literary style: incredible personal adventures, exotic customs, mysterious characters and so on. The tradition of this fantasy has a long history. For example, in his most famous work, \"The Two Seas Under the Sea,\" Captain Nemo discovered the island of Atlantis that sank into the Atlantic. This legend was first seen in the work of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. country\". Verne's uniqueness lies in the fact that his novels show an unprecedented scientific optimism, that is, no one is impossible to achieve thanks to the development of science and technology, or that with the science, the future world will be more exciting. This was not in the 19th century and before in Verne. For example, \"Frankenstein\" is more like a horror and horror Gothic novel in style and theme. The description of science has never been born out of supernatural powers such as magic. Historically, the theory of electric magic originated in the late 19th century. In Verne's novels, detailed figures, professional technical terms, and even scientific principles that have not yet been realized can be seen everywhere. This kind of passage that has knowledge to show off suspects has become the only less attractive in his book. part. The encyclopedic knowledge that Verne learned in the library is amazing, and his literary skills are quite sophisticated. In 1885, in order to commemorate the death of the great French writer Dumas, he imitated the revenge story structure of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" and combined with the background of the autonomy movement of Hungarians from Austria in the 1860s, quickly created the \"Country of Sandov\". . In a letter to Verne, Xiao Zhongma said that in terms of literary style, Verne is closer to Dumas. It can be seen that Verne has the ability to control the literary genre of the novel. Verne is a diligent writer, and a large number of best-selling books have made him a rich man. His series of science fiction novels, collectively known as the \"Singular Roaming\" series, showcased the ideal world of a scientific miracle into reality in the 19th century readers - and in the 20th century, some of his scientific fantasy became a reality. For example, traveling around the world for 80 days, human landing on the moon, large submarines, etc. In the history of science fiction, he gave him the reputation of the father of science fiction.

His masterpieces include \"Blue Blood Man\" and so on. Ni Kuang's work has been remake into a number of Hong Kong movies and TV series. However, some people who oppose Ni Kuang believe that Ni Kuang's work is not a science fiction, but can only become a fantasy or pseudo-science fiction. In the 83-84 years, Chinese science fiction literature was labeled as a symbol of spiritual pollution and was severely punished. The political campaign to resist mental pollution almost made the entire Chinese science fiction cause aborted. The economic and cultural consequences of sports are incalculable. For example, among the mainstream sci-fi writers, Zheng Wenguang was so sick that Ye Yonglie, Tong Enzheng, Liu Xingshi and Xiao Jianheng were unfairly guilty and accused. The \"Science and Art\" magazine founded in the mainland in 1978 became the most important journal of science fiction literature. The editorial department is located in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. The magazine was later renamed \"Science Fiction World\" and grew into the world's largest sci-fi magazine in the early 1990s.

The magazine has made a lot of contributions in introducing foreign excellent science fiction works, publishing famous masterpieces, popularizing science fiction and scientific knowledge.

          "context": "In 1847, John Walter III took over his father to become the publisher of the newspaper. Although the Walter family is becoming more politically conservative, the Times’s remarks remain independent. However, around 1850, the rapid rise of cheap pennies poses a huge threat to the survival and development of The Times. The main threats came mainly from two successful low-cost newspapers: The Daily Telegraph and The Daily Mail. In 1880, Sir Beiyan obtained the ownership of the newspaper and innovated it to make it more important. In 1922, John Jacob Astor acquired The Times from Sir Beiyan. The 1930s was a period of great disgrace in the history of the Times, because the newspaper adhered to the policy of appeasement and publicly condoned German aggression. At that time, the editor of The Times, George Jeffrey Dawson, and the British Prime Minister Chamberlain formed a political alliance to openly support the British government's foreign policy. In 1966, the Astor family sold The Times to Roy Thomson, a big publisher from Canada. It was also during this year that The Times began to publish news reports in the first edition of the newspaper. At this time, the Times was overwhelmed. An industrial dispute that occurred in 1979 caused the Times to cease publication for nearly a year. Until 1981, News Corp.'s Rupert Mayer bought the newspaper for £12 million. Mei Long’s News Group also owns the popular newspaper “The Sun”, which is the largest circulation in the UK and is known for its three-page girl. After the acquisition of The Times, Mei Lan immediately replaced the original editor-in-chief William Liss-Mogg and appointed Harold Evans as the new editor-in-chief. Evans made a large-scale reform of the Times, including the adoption of new interviewing and communication technologies and the introduction of a more efficient management system. In 1982, The Times began to use computer typesetting and laser photo printing technology. The move led to a major layoff in the Times, with the total number of employees in the printing department reduced from 375 to 186. However, at this time, journalists cannot directly write manuscripts by typing. This situation continued until 1986.",

Fortunately, the marriage between Alexius and Empress Irina Dukaina means that the old and new military aristocrats who have fought in this half century have finally reached a reconciliation, and Alexius’ military operations in his early years. He also accumulated enough prestige for him to carry out reforms to save the empire. The biggest foreigner of Alexius when he ascended the throne, except for the Turks who had water with Constantinople, was the Norman overlord, Robert Giskar, who occupied southern Italy. Born out of the pirate nation, Robert, like his nicknamed Giscard, is a veteran military expert. In 1081, at the beginning of the reign of Alexius, Giskar was defeated by the empire of the empire, and the empire's important escort of the empire, which occupied the empire's important trading post, Corfu, and the empire The Thessalonians pushed the new emperor into a dead end. Alexius had to lay down the shelves of the Roman emperors and personally went to the West to seek help from the Venetians and the so-called Roman emperors of Germanic. This diplomatic action has yielded tremendous results: the Venetians, who have been suffering for Norman piracy, have provided well-equipped fleets to the empire, and Henry IV, who has long been dissatisfied with the Normans’ invasion of the Pope and Northern Italy. The world decided to send troops to intervene in southern Italy, which led to Giskar being forced to return to Sicily in 1083, and only two years later had the opportunity to fight East Rome again. This time, his attempt to conquer the Balkans was completely defeated by Aleksius, who was already prepared, and he was also sick. Since then, the Normans have fallen into a dispute of inheritance and innocent battles. The side of the empire has been temporarily solved, even though it has left two hidden dangers that did not seem serious at the time: one is a Venetian businessman who has been involved in the Eastern Mediterranean trade and has been banging on the empire. The other is a generation of famous ambassadors, the eldest son of Giskar, and later the main leader of the Crusaders and the archbishop of Antioch.",

Even later, the Hohenstaufen dynasty, which was the orthodox Roman emperor, joined the hostile alliance against the Eastern Roman Empire. To this end, after the temporary security of the Pechernière and the Serbs, the Emperor Komuning decided to drive the Normans who were always hostile to the empire to the Sicily. The maritime conflict of the Man, but ultimately the elimination of the Norman kingdom, the strategic intention of rebuilding the empire in southern Italy still failed, and only forced the Normans to enter the empire for quite some time. In addition, the Eastern Roman Empire also launched two wars against the Kingdom of Hungary. Although the result was the surrender of the Hungarian king and the empire's direct jurisdiction over the Croatian region, it cost a lot of military power, and the defense of the Asia Minor defense in the Near East again. There is an emptiness. In 1176, after successively forcing the Norman peace talks, blaspheming Hungary, banning the privilege of the Venetian trade, and stimulating the reunification of the Red Emperor Frederick by the Lombard League, the conscious Western Frontier has stabilized the Manuel I rate. The military conquered the Colombian capital of Konya, with a view to fully recovering Asia Minor, for the Battle of Milre Oseflon, which was devastated, despite the reluctance to recover the disadvantages in the later Battle of Mendes River. These are not very successful, and even a purely military point of view can be said to be a failed war that directly consumes the limited military and financial resources of the Eastern Roman Empire, but more deadly, after Manuel’s death, the empire is once again in a court coup. Frequently, the Eastern Roman Empire quickly fell from the ZTE situation after Alexius I and fell into the abyss of total decline. By the end of the 12th century, there was almost only one empty shell left in the Eastern Roman Empire of the Eastern Mediterranean. Its military strength, national strength and manpower were insufficient to cope with the situation of being surrounded by enemies, and the border defense line was on the brink of collapse.",

In September 1451, he entered into an agreement with the Venetian to exchange the neutrality of Venice at the expense of not participating in the Venice-Genoa War. In November of the same year, he signed a treaty with the Hungarian king, in exchange for the establishment of a new fortress on the Danube in exchange for Hungary's neutrality. These treaties are valid for three years, which means that they will be able to attack Constantinople without any interference during these three years. In the past, the Ottoman Empire believed that the attack on Constantinople was too costly and not worth it. The walls of Constantinople are very strong, and no one in the millennium can overcome it except for the Crusaders. But with the advent of the gun, this wall could no longer protect the city. The Hungarian engineer Urban, who provided a huge cannon, was powerful enough to break the walls of Constantinople. At the beginning of March 1453, Muhammad II began to transport the siege guns outside the city of Constantinople. On Thursday, April 5, the Ottoman army appeared on the plain outside the walls of Constantinople. The next day was the Muslim’s main day, and Muhammad ordered the unwinding of the cannon. The final battle with the Eastern Roman Empire began. The defenders of Constantinople miraculously repelled many attacks, but after two months of shelling, the walls were smashed in many places. In the total decisive battle on May 29, the Ottoman army rushed into Constantinople, and the last emperor of the Roman Empire, Constantine XI, died in battle. On the morning of May 30, Muhammad II entered Constantinople and the Eastern Roman Empire died. Muhammad II saw himself as the heir to the Roman Empire. In 1461, the Trabzon Empire, ruled by the last royal family of the Eastern Roman Empire, was also occupied by Muhammad II. By the end of the 15th century, most of Asia and the Balkans had fallen tightly under the control of the Ottoman Empire.",

Christ, a sect, a Christ, a sect, a sect, a Bogmüller, and other heretical sects. The relationship between the religious power and secular power of the Byzantine Empire is very complicated. When the common interests of the empire are threatened, the church and the emperor can unite, and in the event of a conflict of interest, the church and the emperor have a fierce struggle. In general, before the 9th century, due to the harsh laws of the Byzantine Empire and the efficient centralized administration, the Eastern Roman Church was deprived of space for participation in state affairs, and church affairs became part of the affairs of the Empire, East Rome. The emperor became the protector of the church, controlling the appointment and removal of the bishops and the great priests of the two largest parishes of Rome and Constantinople. During the period from Constantine I to Justinian I, many bishops were exempted from teaching by the emperor. The Roman bishops also obeyed the Eastern Roman emperors before the middle of the 8th century. At the same time, no faculty member had the right to expel the emperor. membership. After the 9th century, the power of the imperial emperor gradually weakened, and the strength of the church gradually increased. The church began to intervene in the management of the empire, including hearing any cases handled by secular courts, as well as tax and judicial privileges. However, unlike the Roman church, the Eastern Roman Church has never left the control of the emperor and has always existed as a tool for state power. The literature of the Byzantine Empire includes novels, collections of stories, poetry and other forms. The satirical essays and miscellaneous notes of the Byzantine Empire originated from ancient Greek literature. Their satirical prose contains serious themes in a humorous narrative style, the 10th century \"Friends of the Motherland\", the 12th century \"Mazaris\" and \"The Lord of the Manor\" They are all representative works of Eastern Roman satirical prose. Contemporary medical and philosophical works are also modeled after this satirical prose style.

Eastern Roman music originated from ancient Greek and Roman music, and used music to create a warm atmosphere in court ceremonies, major ceremonies, festivals, and folk weddings. However, the complete music scores left by secular music are rare, so little is known about its music, scales, melody, and tones. The East Roman music currently preserved is mainly religious music of the Orthodox Church, especially the religious music of Mount Athos in Greece. This kind of music is mainly composed of polyphonic music, and the same tone, tone and harmony appear repeatedly. It is divided into high-pitched treble and soothing low-pitched parts. The lyrics of each section emphasize rhythm and do not pay attention to rhythm. The greatest feature of Byzantine art is its decorative, abstract and religious implications. Most of the Eastern Roman art works that are now in existence are mosaics, murals and paintings in churches. The subjects include Jesus, the Virgin and the Son, the angels and angels, the saints of the ages, the emperors and bishops of the ages, and the themes of heaven and hell. The mosaics are mostly decorative, and the planar composition is formulated. The brilliance is used. The main colors are gold and blue, with white, purple, blue, yellow, pink, green, red, black and other colors. The icon of the Byzantine Empire is mostly made of wood, with small mosaics or paints on it, decorated with gold, silver, enamel, ivory and jewels. The Eastern Roman iconic art has had a great influence on the religious art of the Russian Orthodox countries such as Russia and Greece. The Persian miniature painting technique also comes from the fine mosaic technique of the Byzantine mosaic image. In addition to religious themes, there are also some Byzantine painting scrolls that reflect the military, campaigns, daily life, flora and fauna, and other subjects.",

          "context": "Eastern Roman architecture can be divided into three phases, namely, early, middle and late. The early period was the prosperous period of the Eastern Roman architecture. Most of the architectural works were modeled after the Romanesque style. The main buildings include the walls of Constantinople, gates, palaces, squares, arches, elevated waterways, public baths and reservoirs, and churches. After Christianity became the state religion, the church buildings in East Rome grew larger and more luxurious. By the 6th century AD, the unprecedented spectacular Hagia Sophia finally appeared. The Middle Roman architecture reflects the national characteristics of this period, that is, the foreign invasion of the barbarians, the loss of territory, and the decline of national strength. The architecture of this period has shrunk and the scale is not as good as it used to be. The architecture of the Eastern Roman Church during this period was characterized by a small footprint and development in the air. There was no central amnesty like the Hagia Sophia, replaced by a number of small cymbals and with a focus on interior decoration. Representative buildings of this period include the Acatalepthos Monastery in Constantinople, the Chora Monastery, and the San Marco Church in Venice outside the Empire and the Church of St. Sophia in Kiev. After the Fourth Crusade in 1204 captured Constantinople and slaughtered, the Byzantine national power suffered a great loss and was unable to build large public buildings and churches. The number of East Roman buildings built during this period was small and there was no innovation. After the Ottoman Empire annihilated the Byzantine Empire, most of it was damaged. The Church of St. Mary of Constantinople is a representative work of the late Eastern Roman architecture. The East Roman architecture is a masonry structure with concrete in some places. From the architectural elements, the East Roman architecture contains the veneer vaults of ancient West Asia, the classical columns of ancient Greece and the grand scale of ancient Roman architecture, and the architectural form of Basilica. The arches and plaques of the East Roman architecture are mostly in the form of small thick seams to reduce the weight of the vault. From the existing sites, some of the individual buildings in Byzantium's palaces and other public buildings have a central axis symmetry, but the entire building group is composed of buildings that are randomly added during each period, presenting a plane-free irregular layout. In addition, there is a big gap between Byzantine architecture and classical Greek and Roman architecture: classical architecture pursues the overall coordination of vipassana and appearance, and there is no such thing as a simple, visually broken geometric balance in religious architecture, while Byzantine architecture Basically abandoned the aesthetic pursuit of the building, even the Hagia Sophia, in appearance, is nothing but a decorative, bloated red brick shape, only to enter the interior, can bring the clever combination of Qianlong and dome The sense of lightness and grandeur, as well as the brilliant brilliance of the brilliant lighting and colorful decoration.",

According to \"An Food on the East\" written by an anonymous Eastern Roman writer, the Eastern Romans in different regions have slightly different diets, but the staple foods are basically bread and beans. In the capital, Constantinople, due to the high price of meat, the staple foods of ordinary people are bread, olives, onions, lentils, cheese and fish. In the field, cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, chickens, ducks, geese and other poultry meats are widely consumed. Constantinople people like to eat sea fish, freshwater fish are usually used to feed cats and dogs. Other vegetables mentioned in the Byzantine historical materials include radish, cabbage, garlic, onion, pumpkin, lettuce, leeks, cucumbers, spices including sesame, alfalfa, pepper, cloves, and apples, figs, watermelons, apricots and grapes. the Lord. Drinks are home-brewed wines and beers. Olive oil is added to almost all foods. The food produced in various places mainly meets the local needs. The capital and the big cities like Thessaloniki and Antioch rely on imported food and the government's granary allocation. After the loss of Egypt, Libya, and the northern Atlas Mountains in Algeria, Afrika, and Syria in the early 7th century, cereal production decreased, meat consumption began to increase, and wool and linen replaced cotton from Egypt. The main raw material. The costumes of the Eastern Romans also vary from region to region, and the cold and rainy Macedonia and Danube borders in winter are quite different from the arid and hot Egyptian regions. Silk is a royal monopoly of raw materials, silk production is concentrated in the southern part of Greece, and the sale of silk is strictly controlled by official businessmen. Without the permission of the royal family, civilians are not allowed to wear silk clothing at will. The purple silk gown is dedicated to the emperor and the empress, while the high-ranking churches wear brocade robes and vestments. Ordinary people's clothing is mostly made of cotton and linen. From the existing East Roman painting hand scroll, in the 1100's history of the Empire, the clothing style is basically brisk, thin Mediterranean style, the main clothing styles include robes and shawls. , waist cloth, leather boots. The primary entertainment of the East Romans is to watch competitive competitions. The competition includes two-wheeled horse racing, hunting, wrestling, beasts, acrobatics and clown performances. However, due to the influence of Christian doctrine, the cruel, fighting and slave fighting performances of the Roman era at the expense of the participants’ lives have disappeared. Other forms of entertainment include gambling, music, outings, watching comedy and burlesque. The Queen of the Justinian I, Theodora, was once a burlesque actor and her father was a bearer. The sex service industry in Constantinople and other commercial cities is also very developed. However, the Byzantine Empire is strictly monogamous in accordance with Christian doctrine. The minimum age for marriage is 14 for men and 12 for women.",

The traditional trade route through Syria, Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf was interrupted, forcing East Rome to enter the Indian Ocean through the Red Sea. The sea trade and the land trade routes through the Black Sea, the Kasa Khan, the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea. By the 9th century, the international trade of the empire reached its peak. In 1071, the Turks captured Asia Minor. Although it was basically recovered in 1143, the Byzantine Empire gradually lost its commercial base on the Black Sea coast. At the same time, the business of East Rome began to decline due to the rise of Venice and the competition of merchants in Genoa and Catalonia. The Normans invaded the silk industrial centers such as Thebes and Collins in southern Greece, bringing a large number of sericulture technicians and silk craftsmen to Sicily, breaking East Mono's monopoly on silk. Several Crusades, especially the Fourth Crusade on April 13, 1204, captured Constantinople and slaughter, severely ruining the commercial status of the Empire and completely changing the Mediterranean trade pattern. In the several royal struggles of the late Byzantine Empire, in order to obtain funds, the Eastern Roman contenders were repeatedly privileged by commercial trade privileges, causing the already severely damaged domestic business to become more difficult. Constantinople and Trabzon are no longer the distribution center for oriental goods, and their status was taken away by Venice's commercial base in the Eastern Mediterranean. Venetian and Genoese merchants even gained commercial privilege in East Rome, establishing a commercial colony in Galata on the outskirts of Constantinople. By the 14th century, Byzantine’s business had completely shrunk. In addition to commercial taxes, other sources of income for the Byzantine Empire include property taxes imposed on the elite and tax taxes imposed on urban business owners. In addition, the city’s industrial and commercial owners are also levied taxes on horses and cloth. Urban citizens are also required to pay indirect taxes such as notarization, stamping, and judicial taxes. Rich citizens also have to pay for street lamp fuel, festival horse racing, charity, urban sanitation and fire fighting. The agricultural tax in East Rome is collected collectively from the village according to the area of the field, and the tax required for the barren farmland thrown by the fugitive farmers is paid by the village where it is located. In May and September each year, the empire's circuit judges and tax officials go to the countryside to levy taxes, and the land status is censused every three years to determine the tax amount.",

The main reason for this practice was that in 698, the Navy commander Tiberius launched a coup, dispatched the fleet to attack the Constantinople, and the 711 Black Sea Fleet launched an uprising, forcing the Emperor Justinian II to abdicate. After the 10th century, the measures of dispersing military power and reducing military funds by the Eastern Roman emperors also affected the combat effectiveness of the Eastern Roman Navy. After the Battle of Manzi Cult in 1071, East Rome lost most of its naval bases in Asia Minor and then switched to employing foreign fleets to deal with maritime threats. The Venetians, the Genoese and the Catalans provided warships and sailors for East Rome. By 1449, when the new emperor Constantine XI went from Peloponnese to the capital, the Eastern Roman fleet was destroyed, and there was no decent ship. The emperor could only take the Cataloni. The merchant ship of the Asians went to the capital. Due to the military defensive of the Byzantine Empire, its fortification technology has been greatly developed. Among the military defense buildings of the Byzantine Empire, the city defense system of Constantinople is the most representative fortification. In the early 5th century, due to the rapid growth of the population of Constantinople, the Emperor Theodosius II built the Theodosius wall on the wall built by Constantine, which doubled the urban area. Because the city is just a plain of Thrace in Pingchuan, this city defense system is designed to be intricate. From the outside to the inside, the walls of Theodore West are the outer retaining wall, the moat, the moat inner wall, the steep slope retaining wall, the outer city platform, the outer city wall, the inner city platform, the inner city wall, the outer city wall and the inner city wall with more than 300 towers. , the corner building and the bunker, forming a powerful fire support system. In the history of the Byzantine Empire, there were many outstanding military generals, such as Baili Saliu, Narcis, Diofeilus, etc. Many Eastern Roman emperors were also military-born and had excellent military leadership, such as being called Basil II of the Bulgarian butcher.

This defeat and the death of Emperor Valence can be seen as the time between the ancient empire and the medieval empire. The heir of Valence, Theodosius I, separated the entire empire again. In 395 he handed over the two parts to his two sons, Arcadios and Honorius. Arcadios became the ruler of the East, and he was scheduled to be in Constantinople; Honorius became the ruler of the West, and his capital was Milan. From this time on, the empire in the east is generally known as the Eastern Roman Empire. The Eastern Roman Empire basically avoided the catastrophe suffered by the Western Roman Empire in the third and fourth centuries. There are many reasons for this. First of all, the urban culture of East Rome is quite mature. Secondly, when the nationality migrated, the main attraction of the barbarian invasion was the wealth of Rome. In the 5th century, the Western Roman Empire was repeatedly invaded and looted. The Eastern Roman Empire often avoided the catastrophe as long as it contributed. Theodosius II strengthened the walls of Constantinople, making the city a city that the barbarians could not break. In 476, when the Western Roman Empire died, Leo I of the Eastern Roman Empire negotiated with the Visigoths. He ended the threat of the Visigoths to the Eastern Empire, but he no longer intended to conquer the Western Empire.",

The plague of the 541 spring caused the first devastating blow to the empire. The plague began in the Nile River, destroying one-third of the empire's population. In Constantinople alone, more than half of the citizens died. According to the records of the East Roman history official, there were not enough people to bury the dead: the piles of bodies were thrown into the burial pit, the princess was buried with the eunuch, the priest and the niece were buried, and the guards were buried with the shackles. The public cemetery was quickly filled, and the emperor ordered the roof of all the towers on the wall of Galata City to be thrown away. The body was thrown in from above and filled with a top. Soon, all the towers were filled with corpses, and the dead were buried in the sea. Some of the bodies have rotted and stuck with the mat, and a yellow-brown pus floating on the Golden Horn. The speed of the sea-going shuttle cannot keep up with the speed at which the citizens have passed away, and the sea burial is too late. In the fall of 541, the plague disappeared. However, in the next 70 years, it broke out several times, destroying the taxation and the source of the soldiers of the Eastern Roman Empire, and the currency of the Eastern Roman Empire was on the verge of collapse. In 615, the Avar's army stormed into the empire and continued to move to places just a few miles away from Constantinople. In Asia, the Eastern Roman Empire was attacked by the Sassanid dynasty in the Middle Persia region. In 611, Ilan Shahr occupied Cappadocia, then occupied the richest Syria in the Tifor area of the eastern Roman Empire, and the third largest city of Antioch, and invaded Palestine in 618. In 619, it occupied Egypt and completely occupied Egypt in 621, plundering the most sacred Christian artifacts. The loss of territory also quickly led to a reduction in the food supply of Constantinople. In 618, the policy of distributing bread to the Roman citizens of the capital Constantinople was terminated. At this time, three-quarters of the territory of the original Eastern Roman Empire has been lost: Levante on the east coast of the Mediterranean, Egypt, Libya, and Asia Minor, except the northern and southern sections of the Mediterranean, have fallen into Kuss II of Elan Shahr The hands of Thrace, Greece, and Italy were occupied by the Slavs, the Avars, and the Lombards. The Avar and the Yilan kingdoms were eager to see the East Roman Empire.

He has helped the Ming Dynasty sects and the people to cross the sea and settle in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. In addition, Zheng Chenggong allowed Chinese businessmen to receive Zhengfu Token and Guoshengye Banner to help protect the safety of Chinese when doing business overseas. At that time, many overseas Chinese businessmen adopted this law and were able to go to sea for business. However, the army that dominated tens of thousands of people resisted the Qing, but it was unable to obtain a large base. Zheng Chenggong was forced to prepare food grains through overseas trade. At that time, the Dutch often robbed Zheng and overseas Chinese to Southeast Asian merchant ships. Zheng Chenggong repeatedly sent water troops to fight against the Dutch fleet, and twice warned the Dutch during the tenth to fourteenth years of Yongli, unless the Dutch stopped robbing the Chinese merchant ships. It will not trade with the Netherlands. After the failure of the Northern Expedition in Nanjing, Zheng Chenggong suffered a serious injury and faced the problem of insufficient military food. In order to solve the problem of logistics support for the army, Zheng Chenggong decided to follow the advice of He Bin when he was captured by the Dutch East India Company. In the fifteen years of Yongli, Zheng Chenggong had a rate of 25,000 soldiers and hundreds of warships. He started from Jinmen, Luowan, and entered Taiwan through Penghu. The Dutch authorities have two defensive fortifications in the southwest of Formosa Island. One is the Resin City, which is located in the upper reaches of the Taijiang River. On March 14 and 24 of the same year, Zheng Chenggong wrote to Yu Yi twice to surrender. The messenger said: This place is not the only place to be trained. The coming of the Lord is to restore his homeland. Later, the \"General History of Taiwan\" included \"The Dutch Guardian Book\" was different from the Dutch book at the time. Therefore, the book \"The Dutch Guardian Book\" was considered suspicious by the scholars and may even be fabricated. On April 2, Zheng Jun entered the Taijiang River via the Lu'ermen Waterway and landed at Hefei Port. He intended to seek the weak defense of the Promenade. Later, Zheng Jun launched a naval battle with the Dutch warships in the Taijiang waters, hitting the Hecht of the Dutch warships, gaining control of the inland waters of the Taiwan River, and simultaneously defeating the Dutch Army in the northern part of the area, surrounded by the superior forces.",

On May 18th, the 15th year of Yongli, Zheng Chenggong changed Akasaka to Dongdu Mingjing, and set up Tiantian and Tianxing and Wannian counties. However, although Mr. Lian Yatang did not specifically indicate the source of citations with the Dutch Guardian Book, the situation of the two sides' documentary records during the wartime period is not uncommon in ancient and modern times, such as Shen Yourong in the Ming Dynasty. After obtaining the Promenade as a base, Zheng Jun immediately surrounded the city by the sea and the land. Zheng Chenggong did not intend to make a protracted war, considering that the 20,000-strong army's grain dispatch was not easy. At the beginning, he pressured the city to try to coerce the Dutch army to surrender. After the Dutch chief executive refused his surrender request, Zheng Chenggong once ordered a strong attack on the hot blue city, but suffered a very stubborn resistance from the Dutch army. Zheng Jun suffered heavy losses. Due to the strong attack and the shortage of food in the army, Zheng Chenggong was forced to change his strategy, sending most of the troops to the fields of the north and the south, collecting money and grain, in order to solve the urgent needs of the army's lack of grain, and to adopt a long-term strategy of enshrining the city. In the fifteenth year of Yongli, the Dutch East India Company arrived in Batavia for reinforcements. In addition to more than 600 soldiers and eleven warships, the reinforcements also brought a lot of supplies to the city. With gunpowder. When Zheng Chenggong’s military power was still scattered throughout Taiwan, the task of stationing in the big members and the town of Promin’s city was estimated to be less than 3,000, which caused the Dutch army to rekindle hopes of counterattack. In the middle of July of the 15th year of Yongli, the Dutch reinforcements anchored in the open sea suffered strong winds and were forced to leave the coast of the big man and go to the lagoon to escape the wind and rain. Among them, the Dutch warship Urck was stranded and the crew members were captured by Zheng Jun. This change caused Zheng Jun to obtain a full-fledged fighter. When the Dutch warship returned to the sea of large members in August, Zheng Jun failed to reconcile the majority of the troops, but he was ready to complete the battle.",

In December, Zheng successfully arrived in Jieyang, Chaozhou, Guangdong Province, and met with Zheng Hongjun. After the two men discussed, Zheng Chenggong decided to continue to lead the army to the south, and Zheng Hongjun moved to Xiamen to defend. In the same year, accompanied by Mr. Zeng Ying and others, Mr. Lu came to Xiamen to vote for Zheng Chenggong and was placed in Kinmen. In the first five years of Yongli, Zheng successfully arrived in South Australia. On February 25, the Zheng Jun Fleet encountered a storm near Yanzhou Port. Zheng Cheng’s main ship almost collapsed and overturned. Almost all the ship's appliances, including the Ding stove, were lost. It was recorded that even the food on the ship could not be prepared. Zheng Chenggong himself is also hungry for two meals. It was not until the next afternoon that the wind and rain gradually stopped, and Zheng Chenggong’s main and auxiliary boats were able to return to the shore to meet the fleet. This is the biggest sin of Zheng Chenggong himself at sea. Afterwards, Zheng Chenggong also rewarded the two drivers of the main and deputy Chinese military ships. In March of the same year, Zheng Jun arrived at the Guangdong Daxing Institute. On the other hand, Qing Xuejian governor Zhang Xuesheng learned that Zheng Chenggong’s main army had already traveled to Guangdong. Xiamen’s defenses were loose and seemed to have a chance to attack. It was ordered that Ma Degong and Wang Bangjun attacked Xiamen. Ma Degong held Zheng Zhibao in Nan'an, ordered him to surrender the ship to carry the Qing army to Xiamen, and successfully defeated Zheng Jun on the sea. In the face of the Qing army, Zheng Zhiwan, who was in charge of Xiamen's defense, did not fight before, but only took care of the property to be transported to a private ship and fled; it made the Qing army break through Xiamen quite easily and plundered Zheng's savings and equipment. Suddenly, Mrs. Dong and Zheng Chenggong’s eldest son Zheng Jing had only had time to carry the ancestral tablets to avoid the sea. After the Qing army had a sneak attack, it did not intend to stay in Xiamen to fight with Zheng Jun, so it was returned to the interior with full of spoils. At this time, Zheng Hongjun, who was rushed to Xiamen for support, happened to be surrounded by the Ma Degong troops who had returned to the sea. They were besieged by the horse, but they were threatened by Ma Degong to harm their mother and brother. In desperation, they had to let go of Ma Degong. Soon after, Zheng Chenggong learned about the attack on Xiamen in Guangdong. Originally, he still insisted on continuing to work in the South, but he eventually refused to go to the city because of the return of the soldiers. After recovering from Xiamen, Zheng Chenggong pursued the responsibility and beheaded the uncle, Zheng Zhiwan, who fled the battle. Zheng Hongjun, who had let go of Ma Degong, handed over the military power and retired from the white sand of Dongshi Town, no longer asking about political affairs. In May of the same year, General Zheng Jun’s execution was arbitrarily executed by Zheng Cheng’s lower part. Zeng De and Zheng Chenggong used this as a reason to swear the whole family. Although Shi Yi escaped with the help of friends, his father and his brother were executed. After this incident, Shi Hao and Zheng Chenggong made a big hatred, which was once again cleared.",

At the end of the year, including Ding Xihou Zhang Mingzhen and others all came to rely on, making Zheng Jun's momentum more and more high. In the first month of the following year, Qinghai Chengshou surrendered He Wenxing to Zheng Chenggong. In February, Zheng Jun attacked Changtai, and the Qing Dynasty dispatched Chen Jin to the army to rescue. The two armies fought in Jiangdong Bridge. Zheng Chenggong was more familiar with the terrain in southern Anhui. He arranged many ambushes near Jiangdong Bridge, defeated Chen Jin, annihilated most of the Qing army, and won the battle of Jiangdong Bridge. Soon after, he captured Changtai. After conquering Changtai, Zheng Chenggong assembled a large army to attack the Fuzhou Prefecture, surrounded by layers. In April, the Qing army solved the encirclement of Luzhou, and raised hundreds of ships to attack Xiamen. Zheng Chenggong sent Chen Hui and Zhou Rui to lead more than 100 warships. He defeated the Qing army in Chongwu and won the battle of Chongwu. Zheng Jun was a great victory at sea, so the pressure on the city of Zhangzhou was not slightly reduced; however, the defending army in Zhangzhou was also quite tenacious, making the siege situation last for more than half a year. In a few months, the water in the city of Luzhou has been exhausted. A bowl of porridge is sold in silver. The residents feed on rats, sparrows, roots, leaves, duckweed, paper and leather. The soldiers and the people are starving. countless. It is said that at that time, the military and civilians in the city competed for food, even if there were foods in the family, they would not dare to cook, because once they were found to be smoldering, they would be robbed. It is even more rumored that some people have eaten human flesh and the people in the city have eaten themselves. The people are ten dead, and the soldiers and horses are all abdomen. In the sixth year of Yongli in September, the generals of the Qing army led Gushan’s Jin Jinyu to lead a 10,000-strong army to Fujian and entered Quanzhou. Zheng Chengcai ordered the lifting of the encirclement of Zhangzhou. Zheng Chenggong arranged the troops in Jiangdong, and wanted to use the same way of defeating Chen Jin to ambush the Jinjun army, but was smashed by Jin Yu, and the two armies began a scuffle. Zheng Jun’s admiral Huangshan, Liwu Town Chen Yu, Right Pioneer Town Liao Jing, pro Ding Zhen Guo Ting and the guardian right town Hong Cheng Chong were killed in the fierce battle. After Zheng Jun’s defeat in the war, he could only retreat to ensure the safety of Haicheng and Xiamen. The Qing army won the four counties of Nanjing, Zhangpu, Pinghe and Chun'an.",

          "context": "The Yellow Emperor Era, also known as the Xuanyuan Year, is a chronological method that emulates the beginning of the dynasty with the birth of Jesus as the beginning of the dynasty. In the last years of the Qing Dynasty, because of the different speculations about the time of the Yellow Emperor, there are many different sayings about the starting point of the year. It is generally considered to be a product of Chinese nationalism. It was first proposed by Liu Shipei that this era was used in the late Qing Dynasty and the revolutionaries in China. According to the Huangdi era, officially recognized by the Republic of China during the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Qing Dynasty in the late Qing Dynasty was the 4th year of the Yellow Emperor, and the first year of the Republic of China was the Yellow Emperor in 4610. The Yellow Emperor Era was 2147 years earlier than the Confucius Era, 2698 years earlier than the West. In the 29th year of Guangxu Emperor Guangxu, Liu Shipei published the theory of the Yellow Emperor in the \"National Daily\", opposed the system of the year, and also opposed the Confucius Year of Confucius. Liu Shipei advocated that the year when the Yellow Emperor was born was the first year of the epoch, and the 29th year of Guangxu was the Yellow Emperor Era in 4614. However, the Yellow Emperor's birth and death years are not clearly recorded in the literature. Song Jiaoren advocated that the Year of the Yellow Emperor, considered to be the Yellow Emperor, was the first year of the epoch, and the 1904 was regarded as the Yellow Emperor's Age in 4602. This became the mainstream of the Yellow Emperor. . The magazine of the revolutionary school headed by the \"People's Daily\", the organ of the China Alliance, adopted the Yellow Emperor. After the Wuchang Uprising, the Hubei Military Government adopted the Yellow Emperor Era and the provincial governments followed suit. However, in the discussion of the establishment of the Republican government, the Yellow Emperor Era was considered to be based on the imperial law of the emperor, which is not commensurate with the spirit of democratic republic. After Sun Wen became the interim president of the Republic of China, he announced that the Yellow Emperor Era was on November 13th, 4609, as the first year of the Republic of China, and then the Yellow Emperor era was discontinued. At present, some Chinese institutions still use the Yellow Emperor and call it Zhongyuan. According to the proposal of the Kaiyuan Center of Tsinghua University Law School, the Xuanyuan Year is the year after the reign of Emperor Xuanyuan Huangdi, the year of creation of the calendar: Jiazi Year, the year of the first year, according to the Yellow Emperor, Tiangandi and \"Emperor Century\", \"Emperor\" Extremely calculated by the world. The first year of Xuanyuan should be the year of Jiazi, which began in the year of the dynasty, and it was just the year of Jiazi in 2697 BC. Xuanyuan epoch = Western + 2697 years. For example, in 1912, the first year of the Republic of China was Xuanyuan 4609.",

However, in the election of the local council, Huang Yongqin was praised for his local service. In the case of the unfavorable Kuomintang in the general environment, he was elected in the 6th to 10th provincial council elections. He has been operating for more than 20 years and has strong grassroots strength. Huang Yongqin's physical condition was not good in his later years. His daughter Huang Minhui abandoned his education in politics. He has won in the 4th to 6th legislators since 1998 and won the ruling power for the Kuomintang in 2005. The Democratic Progressive Party in Chiayi City mainly came from the transformation of the early party and outside forces, but because Xu Jiaban insisted on no party and no faction, under the leadership of other non-party heavyweight leaders, the DPP, which is slow-growing and even guilty, usually Volunteer support for Xu Jiaban. However, there are also conflicts such as Zhang Rongzang and Zhang Wenying competing for the mayor and Guan Wenxiong to launch the parliamentary review budget. In the election of the provincial councillors in 1994, Cai Hongzhang was defeated by Huang Yongqin due to some minor gaps, and the relationship between Zhang Wenying and the Democratic Progressive Party fell to the bottom. In the 2005 mayoral election, Chen Lizhen left the Xujia class and was elected as a Democratic Progressive Party. However, Zhang Boya lost to his opponent because of his attitude at the last minute. At present, the chairman of the DPP’s party department in Chiayi City is Huang Dayou. In 1950, Taiwan Province implemented local autonomy in counties and cities, and the mayors of counties and cities began to be elected by the people. Since then, Chiayi City has been promoted to the provincial government in 1982, and a total of nine county-level mayoral elections have been held. After being promoted to a provincial city, the mayors of the first to eighth sessions are all women, and it is quite rare in Taiwan politics. Now, there is no such honor. After the election of the mayor of Chiayi City in 2014, the political map was rewashed. The democratic and progressive party member Tu Xingzhe broke through the history and recreated the new forces of Chiayi City.",

Prior to 1986, including the election of the first legislators, the election of the elections, and the election of additional legislators, they were merged with other counties and cities in Taiwan in the same constituency. The number of candidates should be four to nine. In 1989, the last increase in the legislature, the constituency was changed to the county and city. The first place in the Chiayi constituency was selected. In response to the NPC deputies and Taiwanese members, the election was stopped. In the fourth session in 1998, it was changed to two. . In 2008, the seventh legislature was elected and changed to one. After the election of the Chiayi City Legislative Council in 2016, Li Junyi, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, was elected as the 9th Legislative Council Member of Chiayi City. Chiayi City is located in the Jianan Plain. The climate is between the tropical and subtropical boundaries. The alluvial plain and warm climate are quite suitable for crop growth. The agriculture of Chiayi City was greatly increased in 1721, when Zhou Zhongyu, who was then the order of Zhuluo County, built a water conservancy facility. At that time, Lan Tingzhen, who came to Taiping to settle Zhu Yigui’s incident, had a slogan of Lan Dingyuan’s words: Before this, Taiwan’s Zhifu ruled for more than a hundred miles, Fengshan and Zhulu were poisonous and sinister, so that their deaf people still dare not come; today Then the South is full of Langjiao, the northern poor fresh water, the chicken cage is more than a thousand hundred miles, the people tend to squat. It shows the power of water conservancy. After Kangxi, the Han people mainly planted dry crops in the Chiayi area, including rice, alfalfa, winter wheat, beans and hemp. Usually cattle, pigs, goats, chickens and ducks are sideline. Although agricultural reclamation has increased food production, it has also oppressed the living space of the local Hongya indigenous people and has a certain impact on the natural ecology. After the Japanese occupation, the Chiayi City agriculture under the incentive production policy, coupled with agricultural technology improvement and variety research, agricultural product quality and unit area output have increased significantly. The planting ratio of economic crops in Chiayi City during the Japanese occupation period is quite high, and the varieties include fresh fruits and vegetables such as sugar cane, pineapple, banana, longan, lotus, and vegetables. Taiwan's agriculture during the Japanese occupation period has introduced modern agricultural machinery for arable land, irrigation, rice processing or oil production. In the prevention and control of pests and diseases, the Governor's Office of Taiwan and the Sugar Society sent pest inspectors to inspect them to help farmers fight pests.",

In 1958, the Faculty of Law of Wuhan University was merged into the provincial Hubei University. Science Comprehensive University. In 1960, Wuhan University and Wuhan University of Water Resources and Electric Power became the national key universities. After the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, a large number of scholars at Wuhan University were persecuted to varying degrees. At that time, the principal and well-known educator Li Da was persecuted to death. After China resumed the college entrance examination system in 1977, Wuhan University began to emerge from the bottom. In 1978, the old Wuhan University, Wuhan Water Conservancy and Electric Power College and Wuhan Surveying and Mapping College became the national key universities. In May 1980, Wuhan University and the French government delegation signed the \"Meeting Minutes\" in Wuhan. Wuhan University became the only designated institution to cooperate with French counterparts at that time. This opened the prelude to the multi-faceted cooperation and exchange between Wuhan University and relevant French departments, agencies and organizations in various fields. In July 1981, Liu Daoyu served as the president of Wuda University. He implemented a series of teaching and management system reform measures in the school, and vigorously carried out cooperation and exchanges with world-renowned universities, so that Wuda ushered in the first rapid development period after 1949. However, due to its reforms being considered too radical, in April 1988, Liu Daoyu was dismissed. In 1993, Wuhan University traced the school history to 1893 and held a centennial celebration.

          "context": "For thousands of years, electricity was only a curious wisdom of scholars. Until 1600, due to the rigorous academic attitude of William Gilbert, systematic research on the phenomenon of electricity and magnetism began. Gilbert is the royal doctor of Queen Elizabeth I. He is particularly interested in electricity and magnetism. He wrote the first scientific book on Magnetism and Magnetism. This is a book with a modern scientific spirit that focuses on the results of the experiment. Gilbert pointed out that amber is not the only substance that can generate static electricity through friction. Diamonds, sapphires, glass, etc. can also demonstrate the same electrical properties. Here, he succeeded in breaking the attraction of amber. Nature This continues the misconception of 2000. Electrostatic electroscopes made by Gilbert can detect electrostatic charges with a keen sense. In the following century, this is the best instrument for detecting electrostatic charges. Previously, the Italian mathematician and doctor Girolamo Cardano listed the differences between electrical and magnetic phenomena. From the results of Cardano, Gilbert got a lot of inspiration, he proposed more differences: charged substances will attract all other substances, and magnets will only attract iron; amber needs friction to produce electricity, and magnets do not need Any action; magnets will align objects in a certain orientation, while charged materials will only attract other substances. Gilbert created the new Latin term electrica, which means something like the way amber attracts. Because of his many contributions to electricity, Gilbert was honored as the father of electricity by future generations. Later, the English word electric and electricity were derived from electricus. These two English words first appeared in Thomas Brown's 1646 book \"Worldly Paradox\". Later, scientists Otto von Glick, Robert Boyle, Steven Gray, Charlie Duffe, etc., have done further research.",

          "context": "In June 1752, self-taught Benjamin Franklin made a famous kite experiment in ancient and modern times; he and his son flew a kite in the thunderstorm, attracted lightning from the air, and tied a metal key at the other end of the kite line. Between Franklin's hand, a series of electric flowers were produced, and he felt the taste of hemp at the same time, which confirmed that lightning is a phenomenon of electricity. Franklin also experimented with the law of conservation of charge, that is, in any isolated system, the total amount of electricity does not change. In 1767, Joseph Priestley experimented and found that within the charged metal container, the electrical force was zero. From the results of this experiment, he accurately guessed that the attraction and the gravitational attraction of charged objects to each other obey the same law. In 1785, Charles Coulomb experimented with a torsion balance to confirm Priestley's guess that the force exerted by two charged objects on each other is inversely proportional to the distance. He laid the basic law of static electricity, Coulomb's law. Here, research in electricity has been promoted to become an accurate science. In 1791, Luigi Galvani discovered that if the frog and the electrostatic generator were connected into a closed circuit and then the electrostatic generator was turned on, the frog muscles would vibrate. This experiment demonstrates that nerve cells rely on electrical media to transmit signals to the muscles. He thus created the field of bioelectrical science. In 1800, Count Alexandra Volta immersed copper and zinc in salt water and connected the wires to make the first battery: the voltaic battery, which is the ancestor of modern batteries. Volta batteries give scientists a more stable power source than electrostatic generators that continuously supply current.",

Although the result of this experiment, called the triboelectric effect, can attract a slight object or spark, but the power generation efficiency is very low and has no practical function. It was only after the eighteenth century that the Volta was discovered that people got a more viable power supply. The voltaic stack and its modern descendants, the battery, are capable of storing chemical energy and can be instantly converted into electricity when needed. The battery is versatile and can be ideally matched for many purposes and is an indispensable power source for everyday life. However, the battery stores limited energy and must be recharged or discarded whenever the stored energy is used up. In order to ensure that long-term heavy-duty customers do not have power shortages, they must choose strategies for continuous power generation and transmission to users. Electrical energy is usually made by a generator that uses a mechanical-electromagnetic conversion mode. By burning fossil fuels or splitting nuclear fuel processes, heat can be generated, and then the steam turbine engine converts thermal energy into kinetic energy to drive the generator to generate electricity; similarly, other sources of energy, such as wind or water, can also be used to generate electricity. . The shape of this generator is nothing like the same-pole generator that Faraday invented earlier. However, the operating principle on which it is based is still Faraday's law. The invention of transformers in the late nineteenth century increased power transmission efficiency in a high voltage, low current manner; this means that power generation functions can be concentrated in a centrally located power plant. Large power plants can benefit from economies of scale, and the electricity produced can be transmitted to remote locations.",

In the mid-nineteenth century, since William Cook and Charles Wheatstone demonstrated the first commercial telegraph machine, with the establishment of the Transcontinental Telegraph System and the establishment of the Transatlantic Telegraph System, this from the Earth From one end to the end of the earth, using the telegraph mechanism, it takes only a few minutes for people to get the message instantly. Today, the two advanced technologies of optical fiber and communication satellites account for a large part of the communications technology market. The transmission technology they use is still based on the principle of electromagnetic waves. Electric motors use electromagnetic principles to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy to drive a wide variety of machinery. A stationary motor, like a winch, can easily get energy. However, moving electric motors, like electric vehicles, must carry energy equipment such as batteries with them, or use sliding contacts that make electrical energy, like pantographs. This requirement limits its scope of action and performance. The transistor is one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century. The transistor is the basic component of all modern electronic circuits. The most advanced integrated circuit can embed billions of tiny transistors in a small area of a few square centimeters. Electricity is also used to promote public transportation, including pure electric buses and trains. Applying a voltage to the human body causes current to flow through the internal tissues of the body. In the human body, the voltage and current are nonlinear, and the larger the voltage, the larger the current. As the supply frequency changes, the current path is different, and the sensory threshold is different. For the frequency of the circuit trunk, the perceived threshold is approximately 0.1 mA to 1 mA. However, under certain conditions, even a current as small as 1 μA can be felt, causing fibrous convulsions in the muscles. If the current is too large, it will cause muscle contraction, heart fibrillation or burns. Since the conductor is energized, it is difficult to judge from the appearance. If you are not careful, it is easy to get an electric shock. Therefore, the power supply is a dangerous source. Electric shock can cause extremely severe pain, and it is often used by people who are black-hearted to torture. In criminal law, electric punishment is also a method of execution.",

Under this circumstance, Turkey does not recognize the Cyprus government’s sovereignty over the island. The Greek regime that called the government of the Republic of Cyprus, South Cyprus. In contrast, the Republic of Cyprus in the south of the island still holds international recognition including the membership of the United Nations, but because of the lack of participation of representatives of the Turkish descent in its congress, it cannot meet the norms of the original national constitution, and therefore cannot be completely Represents the position of the entire Cyprus. In order to solve the split problem of Cyprus, the international community represented by the United Nations for a long time has always tried to find a solution. Under the mediation of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a referendum called Annan’s plan was implemented on April 24, 2004. Annan plans to combine the northern and southern half of Cypress with a state structure similar to Bosnia and Herzegovina to form the United Republic of Cyprus, however, Through the smooth restructuring of this plan, the referendum, which is required to be held at the same time on both sides of the North and the South, agrees that this proposal can be established. In fact, the result of the vote was that residents of North Cyprus generally accepted the plan of Annan, and adopted the proposal by 64.9%. However, the Greek ethnic group of South Cyprus strongly opposed the proposal and cast it. Up to 75.83% of the negative, Annan plans to fail. The reason why the Greek community and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus objected was that the content of Annan’s plan continued the spirit of the constitution enacted in the United Kingdom and was intended to protect the rights of the Turks, although both the United Nations and the European Union expressed this result. Regrettably, based on the democratic spirit of the people’s self-determination, it is still necessary to accept the current results and find another solution.",

          "context": "The Oscar for Best Picture Award, voted by industry insiders from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, was awarded to one of the highest-rated films in the year, the Academy Awards. This award was originally called the Best Works Award. At the first Oscar, two of the best film awards were presented, one of the best works was awarded to the epic film \"Iron Wings\", and another outstanding work award was awarded to the art film \"Sunrise\". Both of these awards were awarded to the most outstanding films of the year, and their performances were different but equally good. In fact, the judges and film owners have changed their film awards with their influence. MGM boss Louis B. Mayer reluctantly awarded the award to \"Sunrise\" because he did not like the realism of \"The Masses\" by his company's Kim Vido. The following year, Oscar changed back to the single best work award and decided that \"Iron Wings\" was the award-winning film of this award, and that \"Iron Wings\" was always mistaken for the first best film of the year. After years of development, in 1944, Oscar limited the number of nominations for the best film award to five. Since 2010, the number of nominations has been expanded to 10. Some people think that non-English films will only be selected for the best foreign language films. That is to say, only a very small number of non-English films can be selected for other awards other than the best foreign language films because of their artistic value. Therefore, the Oscar for Best Picture Award is almost the best Oscar for English film award. As of 2012, only nine non-English films were nominated for the Best Film Awards, including the 1938 Grand Mirage, the 1969 Focus News, and the 1972 Great Immigration. \"Cry and Whisper\", \"Postman\" in 1995, \"Beautiful Life\" in 1998, \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" in 2000, \"The Letter from Iwo Jima\" in 2006, and \"Love\" in 2012. As shown on this page, the first film of the year was the winning film, followed by the nomination film. Except as indicated by the national flag, the language is English, and the country of production is not otherwise marked. The year shown is the year of filming, such as the 1967 Oscar-issued film produced in 1967.",

          "context": "Proudus is proficient in ancient Greek and is the most famous playwright of the Republican era. According to legend, Proudus has 130 plays, but according to research, only 21 are from his handwriting, and others are fakes by future generations. His comedy was mainly based on the romantic comedy of the new Greek comedian Minand, and satirized the corruption of Roman society. His main works include \"Twin Brothers\", \"Captures\", \"Businessmen\", \"驴\", \"Aphids\" and so on. Born in Carthage, Tarantius was a slave and was later released. He has written six comedies in his life, including representative works such as \"Mother and Mother\" and \"Two Brothers\", all of which have been adapted or translated from ancient Greek new comedies. The structure of the comedy is rigorous, the language is elegant but not vivid, the contradictions in the characters are exquisitely depicted, and the characters are natural. His comedy is not as funny as Proudus, and was only loved by educated audiences at the time. Terrence had a considerable influence on the comedy of later generations. Molière of France, Steyr and Sheridan of England had imitated his works. The golden age is the classical or glorious period in the history of the development of Latin and broad Latin literature, covering the period of activity of two famous figures, namely the Cicero period and the Augustus period. During this period, Rome entered a stage of large-scale expansion, and in the 27th century BC ended the republican system and established an empire. The ancient Roman Empire entered an unprecedented period of prosperity under the rule of Augustus, and Latin literature and art also experienced unprecedented prosperity. During the period of the rule of Octavian, measures to stabilize social order and promote economic development were adopted, which made the once turbulent ancient Roman society show a peaceful and stable scene. Octavian himself attaches great importance to cultural construction. He is a literati who serves the cultural policy of his own. In this period, the great writers Virgil, Horace, Ovid, etc. used to be his royal family. It is for this reason that the literary works of this period lacked the philosophical exploration spirit and political enthusiasm of the republican era, and more affirmed the peaceful life and strong national strength brought about by the existing order. The literary style is not as strong as the previous period, but the skills are more mature and the pursuit of perfection.",

          "context": "In the 100 years after the death of Octavian, history was called the silver age of Roman literature. During this period, Rome was continuously weakened in politics, and internal contradictions became increasingly fierce. The characteristics of its literary development were that the courts were becoming more and more interesting, advocating the fancy of the style and the abuse of rhetoric, making the style seem crowded and bloated. This feature reached its climax in the first half of the 2nd century. The aristocratic youths are fashionable by publicly reading poems that are empty and empty, and literature has become a pastime for a few people. The most accomplished literary style in the silver age is the satirical literature reflecting the subordinates of the slave master and the works reflecting the dissatisfaction of the old republican. Lukan was one of the best poets of the Silver Age, creating the best epic \"Fasaria\" after Aeneas. Matthias is the best inscription poet in this era. The main poem is 12 volumes of the Inscriptions on the Inscriptions, more than 1,500. Its style is short, subtle, subtle, witty and humorous. Juvenal is known for his satirical poems. He grew up in the ancient metaphor of today, the poetry style is severe and sharp, and even if his verse is not genius, anger poetry has become a famous saying. In the 19th century when the European bourgeois revolution was soaring, Givinal’s work received great attention, and Schiller, Hugo and Belinsky gave him high marks. In terms of lyric poems, Stetius is almost the only accomplished poet who is good at describing the tastes of the leisure class. Seneca is the most important tragedy writer in ancient Rome. He is influenced by Stoic philosophy, is good at rhetoric and philosophy, and has served as a teacher of the famous tyrant Nero. He advocates that people use their inner peace to overcome the pain in life and promote sympathy and love. He has written nine tragedies and one satirical drama in his life, mostly from the Greek tragedy. The style of his work is sublime and serious, and there are a lot of moral preaching, which makes his dialogue and characters lack realism. His masterpiece is the tragedy \"Troy Women.\" Seneca was killed by Nero in his later years for participating in the Senate's nobility against Nero's tyranny.",

          "context": "In 1610, Galileo observed the four satellites for several days and found that although Jupiter was moving in the air, the satellite orbited Jupiter, and it was supported by Copernicus's argument that not all celestial bodies orbited the earth. Jupiter's Galilean satellite was named after Io Marius, Europa, Ganimide and Calisto shortly after the discovery in 1610. Before the 20th century, these names were not popular, replaced by the names of Io, Europa, or Jupiter's first satellite. These names were not widely used until the 20th century. Jupiter’s Galilean satellite belongs to Jupiter’s main satellite constellation or Galileo satellite in Jupiter’s satellite classification. Their radius is longer than any dwarf planet, and the diameter is the largest celestial body in the solar system except the sun and the eight planets. Io to Si are the 4th, 6th, 1st and 3rd largest natural satellites in the solar system. They account for 99.999% of the total mass of Jupiter's satellites. The mass of Jupiter is about 5,000 times that of the Galilean satellite. The Jupiter's Galilean satellite, in addition to the long distance of the moon, did not participate in the orbital resonance of Jupiter, and the other three satellites orbited Jupiter. These four large satellites all form a tide lock with Jupiter, that is, they all revolve to Jupiter in the same hemisphere. The distance between Io and Jupiter is 350,000 kilometers, and Jupiter is only 42.5 hours a week. Io's average orbital period has a 2:1 orbital resonance with Europa, and Ganimide has a 4:1 orbital resonance, that is, Eureo bypasses Jupiter for two weeks, and Europa bypasses for a week; Around the line, Gannimide walked around for a week. This resonance assists Io in maintaining orbital eccentricity and, in turn, provides the primary source of heat for Io's geological activities. The average distance between Europa and Jupiter is 670,900 kilometers, and it takes only three and a half days to revolve one week. Its orbit is very close to a perfect circle with an eccentricity of only 0.009. Like other Galilean satellites, Europa is also locked by the tides, so one hemisphere is always facing Jupiter. The orbit of Ganymede is 1.04 million kilometers from Jupiter. It is the third closest to Jupiter in the Galilean satellite. Its revolution period is 7 days and 3 hours. Like most known Jupiter satellites, Ganymede is also locked by Jupiter, always facing Jupiter on the same side.",

          "context": "Io and Europa and Ganyes maintain orbital resonance: that is, every week of Europa, Europa is two revolutions, and Io is four revolutions. When Europa is located near the arch point and Io is at the far arch point, there will be a superposition between the two; and when Europa is near the arch point, it will also appear on the top of the joint. . The top positions of Io, Europa and Europa and Ganymede will move at the same rate, and there may be a Samsung phenomenon between the three. This complex orbital resonance is called Laplacian resonance. Callisto is the Galilean satellite farthest from Jupiter, and its orbit is about 1.88 million kilometers away from Jupiter, much more than 1.07 million kilometers from the orbital radius of Jupiter, which is closest to Jupiter. Due to the large radius of the orbit, it is not in orbital resonance and may never be in this state. Callisto is a synchronous satellite, that is, the rotation period of Callisto is equivalent to its revolution period, which is about 16.7 Earth days. Callisto does not participate in orbital resonance, which means that it will never produce obvious tidal heat effects, and the tidal heat effect is an important driving force for the internal structure differentiation and development of the stars. The simulation shows that Jupiter may have several generations of Galileo satellites in the past. Each generation of Galilean satellites may have been pulled to Jupiter by the gravitational pull of Jupiter's protoplanetary disks and destroyed, and the remaining debris will form new moons. To this generation of Galileo satellites, Jupiter's protoplanetary disk has had little impact on satellites. There is no water present in Io, and the interior may contain rocks and metals. And Europa is about 8% of the quality of water. The Galileo satellite is one of the largest satellites in the solar system. Ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system, and its size is even larger than Mercury. Callisto and Io, respectively, are the third and fourth largest satellites in the solar system, second only to Titan. And Europa is the sixth largest satellite in the solar system, slightly smaller than the moon. All Galilean satellites are sufficient to allow humans to observe with the naked eye when they are away from Jupiter. However, because of the high brightness of Jupiter itself, Galileo satellites will be covered by Jupiter's light for most of the time. When Jupiter is in the rush, the Galilean satellite will have a brightness between 4.6 and 5.6.",

Different periods are often occupied by different civilizations. They are roughly divided into regional environments: Mesopotamia: also known as the two river civilizations, originating from the Asian Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The two rivers civilization is also the oldest civilization with history. The civilization can be traced back to 5000 BC and formally formed no later than 3,500 BC. It was the Sumerians who lived in the two rivers and established the Sumerian civilization. Later, there were successively Akkadians, Hulitians, Kasits, Gurti, Amorites, Elams, Westerners, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Persians, and Macedonians. The greatest civilization after the Sumerians in the two rivers was the Babylon, founded by the Semitic Hammurabi. In the Mesopotamian region, in addition to the two river basins, there is the Karen River Basin, which gave birth to the Elan civilization. The origin of the Elan civilization has not yet been ascertained, and it was initially formed around 2700 BC. Nile civilization: originated in the Nile Valley in northeastern Africa, divided into ancient Egyptian civilization and Kush civilization. The history of ancient Egypt can be traced back to 4000 BC. Around 3150 BC, the king of Upper Egypt, Menis, unified and went to Egypt, and began the history of the Egyptian dynasty. It was divided into the early dynasty, the ancient kingdom, the first intermediate period, and the middle. Eight periods, including the kingdom, the second intermediate period, the new kingdom, the third intermediate period, and the post-dynasty. The Kush civilization was mainly formed in the Nubian region of the Nile River basin, which was initially formed around 2000 BC. Indus River Civilization: Originating from the Indus and Ganges Rivers in South Asia. The beginning of the Xalapa civilization dates back to 3300 BC and was formally formed before 2600 BC. The beginning of the Vedic civilization can be traced back to 1500 BC, and finally formed around 1000 BC.",

There are currently more than 20 different awards covering a variety of film types. As the world's oldest performing arts awards event, its status in the American performing arts industry is equivalent to the Grammy Awards for pop music, the Emmy Award for TV, and the Tony Award for stage plays, and these awards are also The Academy Awards were created for the role model. Since its inception in 1929, the Academy Awards have been held annually in Los Angeles, California. The 1st was held at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood in 1929, and it was a film achievement from 1927-1928. Since the 75th edition in 2002, the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles has become a permanent venue for awards. Since attending the awards ceremony must be invited and no tickets for the ceremony are issued to the public, only the nominees and their close relatives can enter the venue, so the prize itself is a status symbol of the film industry. As the world's most influential film award, its annual awards ceremony is broadcast live in more than 100 countries around the world. Cedric Gybanks, artistic director of MGM Studios, designed the world-renowned little gold man: a knight with a sword standing on a film reel. The five spokes on the film reel represent the first five branches of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences: actors, screenwriters, directors, producers, and technicians. Jibangs' assistant Frederick Hope designed the base of the black marble. The sculptor George Stanley from Los Angeles completed the plaster statue. Currently, the statue is 13.5 inches high and weighs 8.5 pounds. The statue was originally made of bronze and gold. During the Second World War, due to lack of resources, the gold-plated statue was reissued after the war.

One way of saying this is: Ms. Margaret Herrick, the chief secretary of the college, said with amazement after seeing Xiaojin: This is like my uncle Oscar! In an autobiography of Betty Davis, she claimed that she used her first husband, and the orchestra leader Harmon Oscar Nielsen named the Oscar. After this, the people in the society began to use the Oscar as the nickname of the Xiaojin people. After the 6th awards ceremony in 1934, Hollywood columnist Sidney Scholesky first publicly used the title Oscar in his article. In 1939, the Society finally recognized the name Oscar and began to use it officially. For example, the domain name of the official website of the Academy Awards is oscar.com. To date, both Oscar and Academy Awards are still in use. The Oscar jury member's membership of the college must be obtained through the nomination of more than two members of the club or the invitation of the college. The college does not publish a list of its members, but the general media has reported on the invited famous directors. The college has strict rules on the qualifications of the award-winning films. It must be the premiere of the theater in the Los Angeles area from January 1st to December 31st of the previous year, and will be screened for no less than 7 days. In addition, there are clear rules on the length of the film, film specifications, and so on. Nominations for specific awards can only be made by members of the relevant clubs, such as actor members who can only nominate the best actors. At the time of the nomination vote, all members can vote for all awards.",

On June 10th, Guangxu Emperor Weng Tonghe drafted \"Ming Dingguo is a shackle\" and sent it to Cixi for review. He was granted permission and was promulgated on the following day, which opened the prelude to the Reform Movement of 1898. The reform involved political, military, educational, economic and other aspects, and was strongly opposed by many conservative ministers, including the military ministers Shi Yan, Gang Yi and others. They repeatedly expressed their opposition to Cixi. Cixi is also increasingly opposed to the change of view of Emperor Guangxu. The contradictions between the Emperor and the Empress Dowager are becoming more and more acute, and Kang Youwei and others have plans to kill Cixi at this time. Emperor Guangxu plans to go to the Tianjin military parade with Cixi. The folk rumors that Cixi wants to abolish Emperor Guangxu, and there are rumors that Guangxu Emperor will confine the Cixi to the Summer Palace. On September 19, Cixi suddenly left the Summer Palace and returned to the Forbidden City. Then he launched a coup and moved Guangxu to Fujian. Cixi announced that Guangxu was sick, could not see the DPRK, and he was reigning in politics. The Reform Movement of 1898 was abolished. The important figures in the reform were Tan Sitong, Yang Rui, Lin Xu, Liu Guangdi, Yang Shenxiu, Kang Youzhen and other Weixin Liujunzi were beheaded. Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao were exiled abroad. According to Lei Jiasheng's \"The Lost Truth: A New Exploration of the History of the Wuxu Coup in the Late Qing Dynasty\", during the Reform Movement of 1898, former Japanese Prime Minister Ito Bowen visited China. At that time, the British missionary, Timothy Lee, proposed to the reformist leader Kang Youwei that the Qing Dynasty should hire Ito as a consultant and even pay the power. So after the change of the Japanese officials in Ito, the law-changing officials requested to re-use Ito, causing the vigilance of conservative officials. Conservative official Yang Chongyi even played the Empress Dowager Cixi: The story of the Eastern Ocean, Ito Bowen, will be the dictatorship. It is used by Ito, and the world that the ancestors passed down is not to be handed. This fierce remark made the Empress Dowager Cixi return to the Forbidden City from the Summer Palace on September 19th, in order to understand what Emperor Guangxu had for Ito. However, Ito and Timothy proposed to China and the United States and Britain and Japan. Therefore, under the inspiration of Kang Youwei, the reformist Yang Shenxiu wrote on the 20th of September the Emperor Guangxu: Chen Youfu wished my emperor to make a final decision, consolidating the three countries of Britain, the United States and Japan, not to be unnamed. . Another reformist official, Song Bolu, also wrote on September 21st: The Quzhizhi also intends to unite China, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom as the United States, and select a total of 100 people from all over the world. Political and taxation and all diplomatic matters, do not train a number of battalions to fund the shackles. It is planned to ask the emperor to quickly access the foreign affairs, the famous minister of the earth, such as the university's Li Hongzhang, to see the priest Lee Timothy and the Japanese phase Ito Bowen, and discuss with them. I want to hand over the power of the Chinese military, fiscal, taxation, and diplomatic power to the outsiders. After returning to the Forbidden City on September 19, the Empress Dowager Cixi was informed of the incident on September 20-21. She was shocked to see that the situation was serious, and she immediately took the initiative to launch a coup, re-politically, and ended the Reform Movement of 1898.",

However, Li Timo, a senior intellectual, made such a suggestion to Kang Youwei. The motive is doubtful. It may be in the name of Hebang, which induces China to surrender its military, financial, diplomatic and other powers. Kang Youwei suggested to Guangxu. If you want to negotiate with Timothy and Ito Bowen, the control will be completely in the hands of outsiders. Therefore, Li Timo’s plan for the United States can be said to be a diplomatic scam. It uses the weaknesses that Kang Youwei and others have known about international knowledge, and swindles Kang Youwei and others to hand over all important Chinese powers to foreigners. Slaughter. However, Cixi’s captain in the day of the training on September 21 did not mention that Kang Youwei was a traitorous country. He only said: Minister of the Ministry of Military Affairs, etc.: The head of the Ministry of Industry, Kang Youwei’s party smuggling, rumors of chaos, and repeated acquaintances He was dismissed from his post and his brother Kang Guangren was in charge of the army to lead the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of Justice. In addition, both Yang Shenxiu and Song Bolu have played the initiative to advocate the four kingdoms, but Cixi did not mention their crimes in the sins of the Wuxu coup; Song Bolu’s charges were indiscriminate and bad, and Yang Shenxiu’s crime was With Kang Youwei to party. Lei Jiasheng speculated that this was because Cixi did not know the level of participation of Britain, the United States, Japan, etc., and if he blamed the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan and other countries, diplomatic disputes were even more difficult to clean up, so they could only be taken with guilty charges. Since then, Cixi plans to abolish Emperor Guangxu. In the following year, the son of Li Dianjun, Wang Zaijun, was the big brother, and he passed to the emperor. On December 24, Guangxu, on the twenty-fourth day, Yan Jun was taken to the palace. However, the foreign ministers did not recognize their legitimacy, and Cixi had to temporarily suspend the plan. Influenced by the coup of the Wuxu, the Empress Dowager Cixi began to reject the reformists for a period of time, and therefore used the old kings, such as Wang Zaiyu and Gangyi, and even considered the removal of the Emperor Guangxu; the son of Yuxi was thus established as a big brother. With the Chu Jun, but because of the jealous Emperor Guangxu for the consistent support of Europe and the United States and Japan, did not dare to scrap. In order to seek his son's early ascension, he used the Queen Mother's jealousy for foreigners and tried his best to leave the emperor. In the meantime, the situation in the DPRK has gradually evolved into an old-fashioned relative of irrational hatred of foreigners, combined with a conservative Qing school to confront the bureaucrats who advocate pragmatism. In the connivance of Duan Wang and other pro-privilege, even under the help of the dark, the Yihe fist, which started with Fushun superstition and nationalism, was able to enter the Zhili and enter Beijing, forming a situation of forcing the palace.",

          "context": "The Great Wall is a collective term for ancient China to defend against the invasion of the Saibei nomadic tribes in different periods and to build a large-scale wall or military project. The Great Wall stretches thousands of miles, so it is also known as the Great Wall. The existing remains of the Great Wall are mainly built in the Ming Dynasty in the 14th century, from Jiayuguan in the west to the Great Wall in Hushan in the east. The Great Wall site spans 15 provinces and autonomous regions including Beijing, Tianjin, Qinghai, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, with a total of 43721 Great Walls. Heritage, the Great Wall is also the largest single building since human civilization. In 2007, the Great Wall was selected as the new seven wonders of the world. In April 2009, archaeological studies by the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping and the State Administration of Cultural Heritage showed that the Ming Great Wall has a total length of 8851.8 kilometers, of which the length of the artificial wall is 6259.6 kilometers, the length of the raft is 359.7 kilometers, and the length of the natural danger is 2232.5 kilometers. The average height is 6 to 7 meters and the width is 4 to 5 meters. On June 5, 2012, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage announced that after nearly five years of investigation and identification, the total length of the Great Wall in China was 21,196.18 kilometers. This is the first time that China has scientifically and systematically measured the total length of the Great Wall. The north of China has been restless since ancient times. The construction of the Great Wall began in the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period. It has a history of more than 2,000 years, especially during the Qin, Han and Ming dynasties. The largest scale. \"Yanqing State Records\" records: the ancient Great Wall, in the south of the state more than 20 miles, that is, Yansai, Yan Zhao Wang with Qin Kaimou, set the valley plug, from the north of the valley to the west of Liaoning. Qin Shihuang was built for his old site, and the site of the Yongning area still exists in the north of the road. During the Tang Dynasty, because the Turks in the north had been settled and no longer threatened, the Great Wall was not repaired; the post-Jin Dynasty abandoned the Yanyun Sixteen States and made the Song Dynasty build the Great Wall. It became meaningless; the rulers of the Yuan Dynasty were Mongolians, and only some of the gates were repaired. It only serves to check the passers-by and serve as a commercial road station; similar to the Yuan Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty did not repair the Great Wall until its demise. Therefore, the only period of the Ming Dynasty that actually repaired the Great Wall was also the remains of most of today. In the twentieth century, only the Great Wall battle was reluctant to participate in another battle. After the development of long-range projection of hot weapons and the subsequent Soviet/Russian establishment of air force and guided missiles, the Great Wall has completely lost its military function. Modern China's northern defense work was replaced by surveillance satellites and radar networks.",

The Great Wall of China is the longest wall in history. With the recent discovery of 11 Qin and Han Great Wall sites in Tonghua County, Jilin Province, the northeast boundary of the Qin and Han Great Walls has further expanded. The East Han also built the Great Wall, but the scale is small. An explorer from the United Kingdom found a relatively well-preserved Great Wall site in the depths of the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. After investigation and research, the section of the Great Wall site is likely to be built in the Han Dynasty, and after several restorations and reconstructions, it is part of the Great Wall.

In 611, the peasant uprising broke out, and the Sui Dynasty took the summer and Lingzhou lines as the northern boundary, while the Hetao was occupied by the Turks. When Emperor Wendi was in office, in order to prevent sudden abruptness, he repeatedly issued Ding Zhuang to build the Great Wall in the winter. In 585 AD, Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty made the peasant Shaoqing Cui Zhongfang to send Ding Sanwan to the Fangling Wu to build the Great Wall, east to the river, west to Zhangzhou, and seven hundred miles to suppress Hu Hu. When Sui Emperor was in office, he twice spent large-scale labor collections in the summer. At this time, the object of defense also included Tuyuhun in the northwest. \"Sui Shu·Ji Di Ji\" contains the great cause of three years in July: Ding male more than one hundred million to build the Great Wall, west to Yulin, east to Zihe, one after another, the deceased fifteen. On the basis of the former Northern Wei Dynasty and the Northern Zhou Dynasty and the Northern Qi Great Wall, the Great Wall of the Great Wall will be connected to the Zihe River in the east, and will be connected to the Great Wall and the fortified building east of Shibuya through the Fangfang and Lingwu. The construction work of the Sui Dynasty is more common in historical materials, and the construction period is short. So far, the ground remains are rare. The Tang Dynasty did not have the idea of building the Great Wall. Even in the period of the most powerful and violent Khan in the post- Turkic martial arts, Wu Zetian never built the Great Wall. The only history that can be tested is the small wall of the Tang Dynasty, which was built in the north of Zhangzhou. The length of the Great Wall is located in the present province of Hebei Province. The scale is much smaller than that of the Great Wall. A year between 713 and 730. Zhang said that the Great Wall built by the \"Old Tang Book\" and \"Zi Zhi Tong Jian\" are not recorded. They are only included in the Geography of the New Tang Book and the Whole Tang Wen. This section of the Great Wall may be built to defend against the Qidan, the Yi or the post-arc, but the Tang Dynasty’s northern defense system mainly used the Three Downs and its military towns. Since 720 AD, there has never been a sudden after the Tang Dynasty. The record of the border entry.",

This is also the majority of the Great Wall that we have seen so far. The Inner and Outer Great Walls of Shanxi and Hebei: The outer Great Walls of Shanxi and Hebei are basically in line with the provincial boundaries of Mohism and Mongolia. They are generally considered to be the borders of the northern and southern Ming Dynasty. However, Ge Jianxiong pointed out that the Ming Dynasty’s rule over the territory north of the Great Wall was not stable, and the management time was relatively short and inefficient. In the early Ming Dynasty, in order to fight against the North and the subsequent splits of the hustle and bustle, the Ming army repeatedly attacked, and also built the Great Wall along the front line. The important sections of the city are covered with stone, and the enemy, the fortress, and the gates are used for garrison. At the same time, the long-term hereditary military service system along the border is established to enable them to guard the frontiers for generations. After Emperor Taizong Yongle moved to Beijing in the 19th year, it also built the Inner Great Wall along the Taihang Mountain in Shanxi and Hebei as the second line of defense. The inner and outer Great Walls gather in the west side of the city of Luzhou, Shanxi. The outer Great Wall runs from west to east, from Lao Niuwan in Pianguan County, Ganzhou City, along the border line between Shanxi and Inner Mongolia.

In the event of enemy situations, smoke is applied during the day, the night is ignited, and the platform is connected to transmit messages. According to historical documents, unearthed Han dynasty and field trips, the number of baboons is large and extends far beyond the Great Wall. According to the location and function of the 烽燧 configuration, it can be divided into four groups: the beacon tower located in the depths of the desert is the front line that sends out the warning.

However, since the Great Wall appeared, the beacon tower along the Great Wall was closely integrated with the Great Wall and became an important part of the Great Wall defense system. Some even built it on the Great Wall, especially in the Han Dynasty. The court attached great importance to the construction of the beacon tower. The bonfire, also called 烽燧, is a measure of the ancient military intelligence alarm, that is, the enemy burns smoke during the daytime infringement, and at night, the fire is ignited with visible smoke and light to alert the parties and superiors. In the Han Dynasty, the beacon tower was called the plaque and the pavilion. The Tang and Song dynasties were called the martial arts, and the word 烽燧 was also extended to the beacon tower. In the Ming Dynasty, it was generally called the smoke pier or the pier. The beacon towers are generally about 10 miles apart. In the Ming Dynasty, there were also distances of about 5 miles.

The jurisdiction is roughly the main urban area of Chongqing, and Beibei City is the seat of the Central Executive Yuan and the Provisional Government. From 1937 to 1944, Chongqing was the wartime capital of the Republic of China. There are tens of thousands of enterprises and schools. Nearly 80,000 tons of gold have been relocated to Chongqing. Chongqing has become the political, economic and cultural center of China during the war and the Far East Command Center of the Anti-Fascist War. In addition, the National Revolutionary Army Air Force combat aircraft, the US Volunteer Flying Group Flying Tigers have been stationed in Chongqing. In the war of resistance, Chongqing organized a total of 620,000 Sichuan troops, accounting for more than half of the total number of Sichuan troops. It is the absolute main force of the Sichuan Army. More than half of the 57 divisions out of the Sichuan operation are Jialing Dao soldiers. From February 18, 1938 to December 19, 1944, Japan carried out a strategic bombing of the capital of Chongqing for six and a half years. Among them, the massive tunnel tragedy on June 5, 1941 caused 7764 people to suffocate and die. Later, Jiang Zhong was setting up a spiritual fortress at Zourong Road and Wusi Road in Yuzhong District to show the determination of the National Government and the Chongqing people to fight the war in the end, and would not be willing to surrender and die. In the Yuzhong District People’s Park, there is a memorial to the firefighters in Chongqing. There is also a Chongqing bombing memorial site near the Linjiangmen Metropolitan Plaza. In 1945, the Sino-Japanese War ended and the National Government was still in Nanjing. In the subsequent Constitutional National Congress, although the capital of the Republic of China was not specified, it was legally required to stipulate Chongqing as a permanent companion. After the National Government moved to Taiwan in 1949, Chongqing was the legal status of the permanent capital of the Republic of China. It is still valid today. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, in order to avoid civil war and fight for peace, the National Government and the Communist Party of China conducted a 43-day peace talks in Chongqing. On February 10, 1946, a riot occurred during the celebration of the successful meeting of the Political Consultative Conference in Jiaochangkou, Chongqing. Li Gongpu and Shi Fuliang said that they were beaten. More than 60 people, including Guo Moruo, Tao Xingzhi, Zhang Nai, and journalists and labor associations, were also injured. The CCP official later called it a more bloody case, while the Republican Party said it was a relatively incident.",

On the 9th of the same month, the South Bank fire destroyed more than 80 homes. On October 11, 1949, the presidential decree announced that the government will move to work for the second time on October 15. On October 13, 1949, Li Zongren’s acting president was moved from Guilin to Guangzhou, and the heads of the Executive Yuan moved from Sui. On October 15, 1949, the National Government was officially declared to be in office. On October 18, 1949, the people from all walks of life welcomed the government's move to the conference. On November 1, 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army attacked Chongqing's Nanquan Campaign. On November 27, 1949, the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang directly authorized Zhongtong to finally resolve the CCP political prisoners detained in Zhazidong and Baigongguan. More than 400 CCP political prisoners were executed and were called the 11.27 incident. On November 28, 1949, the National Government moved from Chongqing to Chengdu. On November 30, 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Chongqing, and later became the resident of the Southwest Military and Political Committee. It was the central municipality directly under the Central Government, and the southwestern region was also stationed in Chongqing. In June 1952, after two years of assault-type construction, the Chengdu-Chongqing provincial capital Chengdu and the then-Chongqing-Chongqing-Chengdu Railway were completed and became the first railway line built after 1949. Liu Bocheng, chairman of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, ordered the award of the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau to complete the road to Chenglu Road for two years, realizing the Sichuan people's 40 years of road building aspirations. Mao Zedong wrote inscriptions to celebrate the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and continued to work hard to build Tiancheng Road. In July 1954, the southwestern region and the Chuandong administrative district were abolished. Beibei City, the capital of the Sichuan Provincial Administrative Region, was merged into Chongqing. Chongqing was reduced from a municipality to a provincial city and merged with Sichuan Province. In 1964, the Beibu Gulf incident broke out and the construction of the third line began. Chongqing became the core city of the third-line construction. During the four years from 1964 to 1968, more than 270,000 employees were moved from Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Northeast China, accounting for more than a quarter of the employees of Chongqing at that time. In 1965 and 1979, the Sichuan-Chongqing Railway and the Handan Railway, which were the key control railway projects for the national three-line construction, were opened to traffic. In 1975, the number of migrant workers from the third-line construction of Chongqing's main urban area reached the highest peak, with a total population of 435,000, accounting for 1/4 of the population of Chongqing at that time.",

Due to the large number of arsenals in Chongqing, there are not only a large number of military factory workers and semi-military college students, but also heavy equipment such as self-propelled anti-tank guns, rockets, tanks, warships, heavy landing craft, etc., causing very large losses. Chongqing Dawudou between July 1967 and September 1968 caused serious damage to the industrial area of Chongqing, and some streets were razed to the ground. Among them, Yangjiaping Wudou, which occurred in several military enterprises in Jiulongpo District, sensationalized the country. The Shapingba Park in Shapingba District now has the only remaining Red Guards Cemetery in the country. In Wudou, a total of 1,170 people died in Chongqing, injured more than 7,000 people, missing more than 600 people, and direct economic losses exceeded 200 million yuan. In 1982, eight counties in the Yongchuan area were merged into Chongqing, and Chongqing became a separate city. In 1992, Chongqing became an open city along the Yangtze River. In September 1996, the central government approved Chongqing to host Wanxian City, Liling City and Lijiang River in Sichuan Province. On March 14, 1997, at the fifth meeting of the Eighth National People's Congress, the proposal of combining the former Chongqing Municipality, Wanxian City, Liling City and Lancang District to establish a Chongqing municipality was reviewed and approved; On the 18th, the government agencies of Chongqing Municipality officially re-listed. In October 2005, the 5th Asia-Pacific City Mayor Summit was held in Chongqing and designated Chongqing as the permanent host city. A total of 41 countries and regions, 123 cities attended the conference. On January 16, 2009, the State Council issued the \"Several Opinions of the State Council on Promoting Chongqing's Urban and Rural Reform and Development\", and identified Chongqing as a national pilot project for urban and rural comprehensive reform, so that Chongqing can coordinate urban and rural development in rural areas. The reform of institutional issues can be tried first. On June 18, 2010, Chongqing Liangjiang New District was formally established as an economic management zone. This is also the third national-level development zone in China after Pudong and Binhai. On the eve of the convening of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in February 2012, the incident of Wang Lijun in Chongqing led to the departure of Bo Xilai, secretary of the CPC Chongqing Municipal Committee, which caused great concern to Chongqing at home and abroad. Since then, Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang of the State Council has taken over as the secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, marking the end of Chongqing's singer-song era. However, Wang Lijun’s incident and Bo Xilai’s violation of discipline have affected investors’ judgments on the environment in Chongqing, which has adversely affected the investment attraction of Chongqing. On the eve of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in July 2017, Sun Zhengcai, then secretary of the CPC Chongqing Municipal Committee, was investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection for serious violations of his discipline. His position was replaced by Chen Miner.",

The added value of the primary industry was 84.452 billion yuan, up 5.1%; the added value of the secondary industry was 554.28 billion yuan, up 21.8%; the added value of the tertiary industry was 362.381 billion yuan, up 10.8%. Chongqing's economic development is relatively fast. During the period of Huang Qifan's administration, there was a Chongqing model. The most significant problem in Chongqing's economy after its direct administration is that it was incorporated into a large number of underdeveloped regions during the period of direct administration, causing excessive regional imbalances and serious economic and social problems. The income gap between urban and rural residents is as high as 500%, and the backward rural economy severely restricts Chongqing's economic development. Although the per capita GDP of the 11 districts and 4 counties before the municipality directly under the jurisdiction of Chongqing has exceeded 44,000 yuan, the per capita GDP of the 9 districts of Chongqing's main city has exceeded 85,000 yuan. Among them, the per capita income of Yubei District reached 24,480 yuan, ranking first in the county-level administrative units of non-coastal provinces in China. However, the per capita GDP of many backward counties in the suburbs is only less than 5,000 yuan, which is only comparable to Qinghai and Tibet. The most economically backward Chengkou County is one of the ten poorest counties in the poverty-stricken counties issued by the State Council in 2008. Chongqing's urban core area accounts for 9% of Chongqing's jurisdiction, but it accounts for 92% of Chongqing's output value. This reflects the huge gap between the rich and the poor in Chongqing's urban and rural areas. Chongqing is the most active city for China's foreign trade. In the first eight months of 2013, Chongqing’s foreign trade import and export value was US$41.21 billion, an increase of 16.9% over the same period of the previous year. Among them, exports were 28.3 billion US dollars, an increase of 9.1%; imports were 12.91 billion US dollars, an increase of 38.5%. The total value of foreign trade imports and exports ranks 10th in the country, ranking first in the 12 provinces and cities in the west. Chongqing is rich in agricultural resources and grows more than 6,000 kinds of various types of plants. Among them, medicinal plants are prominent, and it is one of the important places for Chinese herbal medicines in the country. There are more than 560 kinds of artificially cultivated plants, mainly rice, corn, wheat and sweet potato, especially rice. The economic crops include rapeseed, peanut, tung tree, black mulberry, tea, sericulture, yellow kenaf, flue-cured tobacco, etc. The fruit trees are mainly citrus, pear, plum, peach, alfalfa and longan. The Shizhu Tujia Autonomous County is known as the hometown of Huanglian, and the Fuling District is known as the hometown of mustard.

In 2012, there were 225 Fortune 500 companies in Chongqing. In 2012, the computer-based electronics industry will replace the automobile and motorcycle industries as the first pillar industries in Chongqing. As Chongqing resumed its direct administration, the industrial base of the new Chongqing area, which was called the three prefecture-level cities of Fuling, Wanxian and Qijiang of Sichuan Province, was relatively weak. This part accounted for 72% of the total area of Chongqing. Industrial output only accounts for 9.5% of Chongqing's city. The largest companies and only two listed companies are Fuling Taiji Group and Wujiang Group in Fuling District. As one of the important construction directions of the new Chongqing area, industrial enterprises are moving from these areas to the outside of Chongqing, which is the only way to go. Chongqing is one of the important financial centers in western China. In 2012, the added value of the financial industry in the city was 91.565 billion yuan, up 20.8%, accounting for 8.0% of the city's GDP. It ranks fourth in cities across the country, and the non-performing asset ratio is only about 1%. , ranked in the top three in the country. It has a financial organization system with complementary functions such as banking, securities, insurance and various financial intermediary services. The number of financial institutions is the highest in the west. Since the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, China-Russia Daosheng Bank and HSBC entered Chongqing in the early part of the last century. In 1933 and 1934, Chuanyan Bank and Bank of China Chongqing Treasury were built in Chaotianmen and Xiaojiao Street respectively. Since Chongqing merged into Sichuan Province in 1953, many banks moved to Chengdu and Guiyang, and the Chongqing banking industry entered a depression period of more than 40 years.",

Vehicles of this type include tanks, aircraft, and ships. Civil vehicles can also be attached to armor. These vehicles include journalists, officials, or other vehicles that enter or leave the conflict zone or certain areas of high crime, as well as the president's black-headed car. Armored vehicles are also the regular equipment of the security company, used to transport money, carry valuables, and reduce the risk of cargo interception or robbery. In addition to deliberate attacks, armor on the vehicle can also avoid some non-human threats. Some spacecraft are equipped with special armor to resist the impact of small meteorites or debris from space debris. Even general civilian aircraft carry armor and are built on the inner walls of these gas turbine engines in the form of fragment-like shields to avoid possible injury or damage to the compressor/turbine. The design and use of the vehicle determines the amount of armor it is mounted on, often limiting the maneuverability of the vehicle when the armor is heavy and too numerous. Armored vehicles are sometimes ordered only during armed conflicts. In World War II, US tank crews even welded excess tank tracks to their M4 Shell, M3 Lee or Stuart tanks. During the Vietnam War, the US military's armed trucks were armed with sandbags and steel pieces made in place. In the past few years, Iraqi US troops have used some scrap metal to load horse-drawn carriages or some other military transport vehicles: such armor is usually called a pilgrim, while the US military is often called earthen armor. Most of today's heavy-duty rigs are main battle tanks. They are pioneers of ground force and are designed to withstand the threat of anti-tank missiles, kinetic energy armor-piercing or nuclear and chemical weapons. Some tanks even have slanted armor. Israel's Merkava tanks are designed to provide additional armor support for each tank component to protect the occupants. The outer armor is not only modular but also capable of quickly replacing damaged armor.",

          "context": "Interstitial armor protection can be used against high-explosive anti-tank bombs, which create a highly concentrated plastic metal jet that is very effective for key strikes, but not for gap armor. Thinner steel plates or even iron meshes can be lighter than fully protected armor, so they can be attached to the outer edge of a tank turret or to other armored vehicles. This light armor will cause the warhead to detonate prematurely, causing the molten metal jet to accumulate outside the main armor in advance, thus becoming less effective. In the Second World War, there were many factory-made or crude armor used in this way to protect vehicles from new weapons such as Bazuka, Panzerfaust, and other high-explosive bombs. In response to the ever-improving high-explosive anti-tank warheads, the integrated gap-type armor was again used in the German leopard-type tank in the 1960s. The interior of this type of armor remains hollow, increasing the distance from the outside to the inside of the body at a given armor weight, thus reducing the penetration of the conical charge. Some armor even deliberately create several bevels on the inner surface of the hollow gap to dissipate the power of the pre-set path of the conical explosive jet. For example, for a given weight of armor, divided into two layers of 15 cm thick and a single layer of 30 cm thick, the former can have more protection against cone explosives. In the advanced tanks of the 1960s, almost all of them used gap armor as the main body, but they never became the actual mainstream armor system of the main battle tank. Today's light-duty vehicles are equipped with metal mesh, the so-called horizontal armor, and some main battle tanks also carry rubber side skirts to protect their relatively fragile suspension or front underside armor. The HP Shield uses the principle of gap armor to protect the space shuttle from high-speed micrometeoroids. The impact on the first layer will break up or destroy the incoming particles, causing the fragments to spread over a larger range in the subsequent compartment to disperse the energy of the impact.",

These dialects are collectively referred to as Southern Arabic. The difference between Southern Arabic and Northern Arabic is considered to be an independent language. In addition, the Maghreb dialect of Northwest Africa and the conversation between China and the East can not understand each other. However, people in each dialect area can use the classical Arabic used in the Qur'an as a standard to communicate. More dialects are used in Egyptian dialects, Syrian dialects and Iraqi dialects. Because Egypt's cultural industry, especially the film industry, is more developed than other Arab countries. And the novel of the Arab novelist Taha Hashan is widely circulated. Therefore, Egyptian dialects spread to all parts of the Arab world through films, songs, and novels. The standard form of Arabic is called Fosha, enabling local residents to communicate. Arabic is an important language in the world and one of the working languages of the United Nations. Arabic is the universal language of Islam. The Qur'an is written in classical Arabic. Islamists traditionally believe that the Qur'an cannot be accurately translated. Some believers even think that trying to translate the scriptures should not be. With the changes of the times and the need to spread Islam, the Qur'an is translated into many languages, but in Islamic activities it will strive to use Arabic. Although Arabic is closely related to Islam, many Muslims do not speak Arabic. Most of them will recognize the Arabic letters in Arabic, but they do not know the meaning. Just as the vast majority of Chinese people know the Latin alphabet, they don't understand Portuguese. There are many Arabic and Persian words in the language used in many Chinese Muslim communities. However, because the Persians and Turks came to China earlier than the Arabs, the influence of Turkic and Persian on Chinese Muslims was relatively greater before the Ming Dynasty, but the influence of Arabic in religion was greater, so some documents mentioned the Hui people. The religious language is Arabic. However, during the reign of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang implemented the policy of national assimilation, and the Hui people gradually used Chinese and Chinese characters. In the vocabulary of Muslims who use Chinese, they are like the meaning of the game. Arabic words also occupy a considerable proportion in Uyghur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz vocabulary.",

          "context": "British military historian Kosher Barnett claimed that the Treaty of Versailles was actually quite kind compared to the peace treaty that Germany expected to impose on the Allies after winning the war. In contrast to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, Russia lost one-third of the population, half of the industry, 90% of the coal producing area and 6 billion marks of war compensation. Barnett also believes that Germany's strategic situation after signing the treaty is better than that of 1914. The Russian Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which previously played a role in balancing Germany in the East, disappeared, and there was Poland as a buffer between Germany and the new Russia. . In the West, there are only France and Belgium, both economically and inferior in population. Barnett also believes that Britain and France should achieve a permanent peace on the European continent through a way to completely destroy the unified Germany created by Bismarck and re-separate it into a number of weaker political entities. Only by doing so can Germany be completely solved. The trouble brought by Europe, but the United Kingdom did not achieve its goal of participating in the war. If we do not think about the issue from a modern strategic or economic perspective, the Treaty of Versailles planted the seeds of hatred in the hearts of the Germans and then took root under the nurturing of the Nazis. This is also the blatant trampling of the Treaty when Hitler came to power and The reason for winning a domestic cheer. The historian Dan Lorraine said that the chain reaction of the Treaty of Versailles triggered the Second World War. Historians have disputed the view that the Treaty of Versailles weakened and humiliated Germany. Some views are as follows: the Disarmament Commission in the Treaty of Versailles is in name only, the amount of war compensation in Germany is decreasing until it is almost cancelled, the financial burden and the cost of post-war reconstruction in the injured country. In fact, he was transferred from Germany to the victim country. Compared with the Allies, Germany’s economic and industrial potential is less affected by the war. Although Germany suffered losses during the war, the advantage of the German economy compared to its neighbors in 1919 was more pronounced than in 1913. Some critics who have a negative opinion of the Treaty of Versailles believe that the establishment of Poland has protected Germany from its biggest potential enemy, Russia. The Battle of Warsaw in 1920 blocked the pace of Bolshevism's march toward the post-war weak Europe, especially at this time Germany was facing the proliferation of communist trends. There were still Polish-speaking minority communities in Germany after the war, which exacerbated the ongoing ethnic conflict in the history of the German Empire. After the war, Germany maintained a greater influence on the Balkan countries than its southeastern neighbors, while other countries did not try to change this situation. In short, despite Germany's failure in the First World War, there is still the ability to dominate the European situation again in 20 years.",

          "context": "It is generally believed that George hopes to find a middle line in Wilson's idealistic claim and Clemenceau's claim to severely punish Germany, but its political status is quite subtle. When George won the 1918 election, he proposed to the British people that Germany needs to be responsible for the war. At the same time, the Conservative Party in the coalition government also demanded that Germany be severely punished to ensure that it no longer poses a threat to the United Kingdom. In this context, George is striving to increase Britain's share of war reparations and German colonies. He and Clemenceau have large overseas colonies because of Britain and France, and they do not agree with the national self-determination policy. At the same time, George was soberly aware that too harsh conditions would provoke a strong revenge in Germany, which is not good for long-term peace. In addition, Germany is still Britain's second largest trading partner. Too much weakening the German economy will also damage the British economy. Both he and Clemenceau recognize that the United States has become an economic power at this time and will become a future. Military powers, so the national self-determination was intentionally ignored by the two when the meeting was held. George's claim can be categorized as follows: guaranteeing British maritime hegemony, dividing Germany's overseas colonies to strengthen Britain; weakening German military power to a lower level; Germany's war compensation can not be excessive to avoid evoking German revenge; helping Germany to rebuild economic. Before and after the United States entered the war in April 1917, the United States prevailed in isolation policy, and the general public believed that it should get out of European affairs as early as possible. Because the United States gained billions of dollars in trade surplus through trade in the First World War and thus became a creditor country from the debtor countries, the government tends to appease Germany and guarantee equal trade opportunities and smoothly recover war debts. Before the end of the war, President Wilson proposed the 14-point peace principle, which is more lenient than the conditions of Britain and France and is more easily accepted by the German public. The American people generally do not want to have a world war again. Based on this, President Wilson’s overly harsh terms will cause revenge in Germany, and war will be inevitable. He therefore proposed the establishment of an international coalition to maintain the international order, that is, the international community provided guarantees to prevent weak countries from being invaded by powerful countries. However, European powers generally believe that this concept is too idealistic and does not conform to the reality of European countries. Moreover, such a policy will lead to excessive involvement of US military forces in international affairs.",

Its original map, Stewart Island as a peninsula, used the Banks Peninsula as an island. The map of Cook caused the European whaling ship to amplify its activities in the area. In 1788, New Zealand was placed in the colony of New South Wales, Australia, and officially became a British colony. It was not until July 1841 that New Zealand was separated from the colony of New South Wales and officially became a New Zealand colony. After the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840, New Zealand became a British colony. However, the treaty has English and Maori second versions, the British royal representative signed the English version, and the Maori signed the Maori version. The Maori version promised to the Maori tino rangatiratanga, which means self-governance in Maori, but the English version is translated into the position of the leader. The two sides have different interpretations and interpretations. This and other issues are still a must for the New Zealand government and Maori. For example, the ownership of the seabed and the foreshore. In 1901, various British colonies in Australia on the other side of the Tasman Sea; including New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand decided to establish a new country, the Commonwealth of Australia, to transform from a colony It is the state government under the Commonwealth of Australia. The New Zealand colonies had great interest in joining the Australian Commonwealth and were actively involved in the development of the Australian Constitution, but in the end New Zealand still decided to become independent. The Maori War that fought for land from 1845 to 1872, the New Zealand historian James first called this history the New Zealand War in 1987. The most intense battle took place in the 1860s, with the main battlefield in the middle of the North Island. In 1864, the total number of British troops reached 18,000, against 4,000 Maori soldiers. The Maori used the fortifications to resist the shells and successfully blocked the infantry. 1,800 Maori soldiers and 800 European soldiers were killed. Maori sacrificed more than 2,100 people throughout the Maori war. About 16,000 square kilometers of land in the North Island was confiscated by the United Kingdom, and more than half of it was paid or returned to the Maori, but it has had a profound impact on the local tribal society and economic development.",

In the colonial trend, New Zealand immigrants mainly came from the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, because the New Zealand immigration policy was similar to Australia's White Australia policy. There are also many Dutch, Dalmatian, Italian and German immigrants coming together with European indirect immigrants from Australia, North America, South America and South Africa. During the Great Depression, immigration policies were relaxed and the countries of origin of immigrants became more dispersed. According to the 2001 census, 80,000 people in New Zealand use a variety of Chinese dialects at home, 30,000 use French at home, and about 50,000 are in German. New Zealand's unique environment facing the sea and its political, economic and military cooperation with Australia have not directly confronted foreign military threats. Therefore, terrorism is the biggest challenge for national and regional security. After the Cold War, New Zealand Re-examine the structure, actions and capabilities of the defense force, establish the New Zealand Security Intelligence Agency, and give New Zealand the main task of defense force: ensure that New Zealand can resist external threats and safeguard New Zealand's sovereign interests - including the exclusive economy The interests of the district; enable New Zealand to take appropriate action on emergencies in the strategic area in which the interests are located. The characteristics of the country's national defense army are dualized by military and military orders. The defense ministers and the commanders of the three armed forces belong to the military and political system. The commander of the national defense army belongs to the military order system, and directly undertakes the command of the defense minister to assign joint forces to perform combat missions. In 1893, women in New Zealand received the right to vote, the first country in the world to have the right to vote. This is the iconic achievement of the 19th century feminist movement. In 2013, New Zealand followed some European and American countries and regions and became the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalize same-sex marriage.",

The glaze on the surface of porcelain will undergo various chemical changes due to the temperature difference in the furnace, resulting in different colors, namely kiln change. Sintered porcelain tires generally contain less than 3% of iron and are impervious to water, and are widely used by people around the world because of their relatively low cost and wear-resistant water impermeability.

As one of the luxury products of China's specialty products, porcelain has been passed to various countries through various trade channels for thousands of years. Exquisite ancient porcelain, which is regarded as a collection of antiques, is collected by a large number of collectors. The earliest origin of archaeological verification porcelain was in China, but there is no accurate conclusion as to which era.

In the prosperous tea ceremony culture of the Anzuo Taoshan era, many tea people such as the Licun Qizhe's Muc Village, the Putian sweep, the Gutian Weaving Department, and the Zhishan Supervisor are also the makers of the famous tea ceremony porcelain.",

Born in Dazhong Xiangfu on April 14th, Dazhong Xiangfu was sealed as Qing Guogong in the past seven years, and was named the Shouchun County King in eight years; Tianzhu entered the book in the first year of the year, and sealed in the second year. Sheng Wang, in September of the same year, became the Crown Prince, given the name Zhao Wei; in February of the first year of Qianxing, Zhenzong collapsed, Renzong was the emperor, when he was 13 years old; in 1023, he changed his name to Tiansheng; in 1063, he died in 汴In the Liang Palace, at the age of 54, he was in office for forty-one years. The folk priests and priests in the princes are the shadows of Song Renzong; since ancient times, they have also established the image of Mingjun in the Baogong drama. In the first year of Qianxing, he was only twelve years old when he was in the throne. He was listened to by Liu Taihou. Under the leadership of the Queen Mother Liu, he gave up his favorite harem Zhang, and in the second year of Tian Sheng, Guo was the queen. In the second year of Ming Dao’s reign, after 11 years of listening to politics, Ren Zong began to be a pro-governor. The most important military conflict during the reign was in Xixia, Xia Jingzong Li Yuanzhang changed his father Xia Taizong Li Deming's national policy after the throne, and launched the Song and Xia Wars. Yanzhou, Haoshuichuan, Dingchuan and the Song Dynasty all suffered defeats, Han Qi, Fan Zhongyan was beaten after the battle of the good waters. To the battle of Dingchuan Village, the Xixia Army, who was in charge of the Xixia division, was severely resisted by the Jingzhou Jingzhou Jingtai of the Song Dynasty. The whole army was destroyed, and the strategic goal of Xixia’s capture of Guanzhong was shattered. Xixia was difficult to support due to the national strength in successive years. In the end, the two countries talked about it: Xia Xiangsong called the minister, and Song gave Xixia Xia with 130,000 horses, silver 50,000 yuan, and tea 20,000 jin each year.

Then, the Song Dynasty and the Liao Kingdom agreed to maintain the peace agreement of the alliance of the Yuanyuan with the condition of increasing the old currency. Years of spending are not a heavy burden, and the cost of the year is not important compared to the choice of military expenses for war. In the first year of Baoyuan, Shaanxi’s expenditure was 15.51 million. After the Song and Xia Wars in the second year of Baoyuan, Shaanxi’s expenditure in the second year of Qingli was 33.63 million, almost deficit. The economic incentives for the Liao State to lose the looting of the south are also one of the important factors for the Liao and Song Dynasties to maintain a hundred years of peace. In the four years of Emperor Huang, the Zhizhi Gao was against the Song Dynasty, and the army swept across Guangxi and Guangdong. Ren Zong appointed Di Qing and Yu Jing led the troops to the south. In the five years of Emperor Huang, Di Qing night attacked Kunlunguan, and the defeat of Zhizhi was higher than that of Guirenpu. The following year, Yan Zhigao died in Dali and was chaotic.",

The main function of the short-distance artificial high-rise riverbank built in the upper reaches of the river is not to prevent flooding, but to collect the river water, collect the water in the embankment, and inundate the river valley to form a reservoir. There are two main types of modern dams: earth-rock dams and Concrete dam. In short, the construction of the dam is similar to the reason for the reservoir, and is used to collect water. The purpose is generally as follows: irrigation, water supply: providing tap water and irrigation water to nearby areas. Power generation: The use of hydroelectric generators on dams to generate electricity. Flood protection: part of the canal system. The dams are generally built in narrow valleys, because the slopes on both sides can serve as natural walls for the reservoir, and the length of the dam can be greatly shortened. Before the construction, the houses and monuments that will be flooded will need to be moved to other places. The earliest known dam in the world was built in the third millennium BC, located in the Jawa Dam in Jordan, about 100 kilometers northeast of the capital Amman. The gravity dam was originally 9 meters high and was supported by a 50-meter-wide earth wall. The earliest dam in Chinese history is the Anfengtang dam built in Shou County, Anhui Province from 598 BC to 591 BC. The dam is 6.5 meters high and has a storage capacity of 90.7 million cubic meters. It has been running for more than 2,600 years and Dujiangyan The Caohe Canal and Zheng Guoqu are collectively referred to as the four major water conservancy projects in ancient China.",

Conventional deformation monitoring and leakage monitoring of drains and larger reservoirs helps to identify problems early and remedial measures before structural failure. Most dam management mechanisms will reduce the water level of the dam at this time and even drain the water. Another approach is to use a silicate cement for pressure grouting on more fragile rocks. In the event of a war, if the dam is damaged, it will have a significant impact on the population and the environment, so the dam is considered a facility with dangerous forces. Therefore, in international humanitarian law, it is prohibited to use the dam as an attack target if the attack on the dam causes a large number of civilian casualties. In order to facilitate identification, a protective sign with three orange circles is placed on the dam in accordance with the provisions of international humanitarian law. The main causes of dam collapse include inadequate flood discharge capacity, incorrect design of spillway, geological instability due to insufficient inspection and water level changes, improper maintenance, especially water outlets, large amounts of rainfall, earthquakes, man-made, computer or design errors. Before the implementation of international humanitarian law, there was an army attack on the dam during the Second World War.

          "context": "Outer Mongolian independence refers to the historical events of Outer Mongolia's independence from China in the first half of the 20th century. In the Mongolian place of the original Qing Dynasty after the Revolution of 1911, Inner Mongolia is still under the jurisdiction of the Republic of China, while the outer Mongolian region is generally not subject to the independence of the government of the Republic of China. Outer Mongolia has repeatedly declared independence before and after it has been recognized by the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China, but it was controversial during the Cold War. Outer Mongolia includes the present Mongolian country and the Tangnu Wulianghai area. Mongolia is a sovereign independent country widely recognized by the international community, while the Tanguwu Lianghai area is controlled by Russia. When Mongolia was independent, part of the Tanguwu Lianghai was merged into the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic, and the other part was merged into the Kusugur province of the People’s Republic of Mongolia. Today, the Russian-Mongolian border is determined. At the beginning of the 13th century, the Mongolian leader Genghis Khan unified all Mongolian tribes in the region and established the Mongol Empire. Later, Kublai established the Yuan Dynasty, including the Chinese mainland, the Mongolian Plateau, and the Northeast. During the Ming Dynasty, the remnants of Mongolia returned to the Soviet Union and maintained the North Yuan regime against the Ming Dynasty. Later, the Manchu rulers formed an alliance with the Mongolian monasteries and entered the Central Plains to establish the Qing Dynasty. Other Mobei and Moxi Mongolian tribes gradually became members of the Qing Dynasty. The relations between the Mongolian ministries and the Qing government are different; they may be married to the Manchu rulers or conquered by force. In the Qing Dynasty, Mongolia was divided into Inner Mongolia, which is governed by the government, and Mongolia, which was ruled by Zazak. The outer Mongolia is divided into Inner Zasak Mongolia and Outer Zasak Mongolia. Inner Zasak Mongolia was attached to the Qing Dynasty earlier, and it was more married with the royal family. Later it became the main body of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The external Zhasak Mongolia was attached to or forced to surrender during the Qing army’s conquest of the Junggar Ministry, and its status was under Zassac. In the official documents of the late Qing Dynasty, the concepts of Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia appeared. The term Inner Mongolia refers to the 49th flag of the Zazasak, while the Mongolian refers to the 4th of Khalkha. Since the 16th century, Russia has operated Siberia and has begun to travel with the outer Mongolia. In 1727, China and Russia signed the \"Blenschi Borders\" and \"Chaktu Boundary\", which determined that Mongolia was under the jurisdiction of the Qing Dynasty. Tsarist Russia obtained the privilege of trade in Chaktu and Outer Mongolia. In 1854, the Governor of Eastern Siberia, Muraviov, said that in the event of a coup, China should not allow the new Chinese government to extend its power to Mongolia. In this case, Mongolia should be protected by Russia. In the majority of unequal treaties signed by the Russian and Qing government, there are provisions on the interests of Russia in Mongolia. During this period, Russia tried to exchange economic, cultural and military affairs with the Mongolian ministries.",

The aggression, the Soviet government today is against the preface, and is good at private treaty with Mongolia. These acts are exactly the same as those of the Russian government. It is necessary to know that Mongolia is a territory of the Republic of China, and the government is hard to tolerate. The Chinese government will never recognize any treaty between the Soviet government and Mongolia. The National Government of the Republic of China has always been in a situation of internal and external difficulties. From the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, the Central Plains War, the first civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, to the September 18th Incident of 1931 and the 1937 Anti-Japanese War, it was unable to deal with the issue of Outer Mongolia. In the meantime, the National Revolutionary Army in 1928 had a small-scale battle with the Soviets on the eastern border of Mongolia, and then did not enter Mongolia. It was not until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1992 that the Soviet army was completely withdrawn from Mongolia, and Mongolia actually gained independence. At the same time, under the leadership of Qiao Bashan and others, the Mongolian People’s Republic implemented a Soviet-style political system. In 1939, the Soviet Union and the Mongolian army and the Japanese, Manchurian army broke out of the Nomenham battle due to the border crossing issue, and then ceased fighting because of the European war. In March 1941, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yang visited the Soviet Union on the right. On March 27, the Soviet Foreign Minister said to the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union: Stalin received the Matsuoka, which was a pure polite question. On April 11th, the Soviet Union did not sacrifice the interests of the friendly nation for itself. The Soviet government received the reception as usual. However, just two days later, on April 13, the Soviet Union signed the \"Sino-Japanese Neutral Treaty\" with Japan and issued a joint statement saying that in order to safeguard the friendly relations between the two countries, the Soviet Union promised to respect the territorial integrity and inviolability of Manchuria. Japan pledges to respect the territorial integrity and inviolability of the People’s Republic of Mongolia. In this regard, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China, Wang Chonghui, declared that the \"Sino-Neutral Treaty\" is absolutely ineffective for China.",

After the United States used the atomic bomb against Japan, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan before negotiating with China. After the gathering of 1.5 million Soviet troops in Mongolia, they attacked the Japanese Kwantung Army in northeastern China and North Korea. In the meantime, Outer Mongolia provided logistics and sent troops to participate in the Soviet army’s operations against the Japanese army in Inner Mongolia. When Sino-Soviet held negotiations on the issue of outer Mongolia, Stalin insisted that the outer Mongolia is today the People's Republic, and its status quo is independent. At the beginning of the negotiations, China refused to recognize the independence of the outside world. Stalin said that if the external Mongolian problem cannot be resolved, the treaty cannot be concluded. During the negotiations, Chiang Ching-kuo said to Stalin: Our nationals will not forgive us. Under such circumstances, the nationals will rise up against the government. Stalin answered: If you have the power of your own country, you can play Japan, and I naturally will not ask for it. Today, if you don't have this power, you have to talk about these words, which is tantamount to nonsense! After the Soviet Red Army occupied Northeast China, it not only raped Chinese women in northeast China, but also looted industrial facilities worth US$8 billion, more than three times that of Germany. It continued to support communist activities in China. In order to continue to obtain the support of the Allied countries for the Chinese theater, and to prevent the Soviet Union from expanding the Xinjiang Yining incident, assisting the Chinese Communist Party and not withdrawing troops in the Northeast, on August 14, 1945, after more than two months of negotiations with the Soviet Union, the Government of the Republic of China Finally make a compromise. Song Ziwen and Wang Shijie signed the \"Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance Treaty\" with the Soviet government under the authority of the National Government President Jiang Zhongzheng. They agreed to withdraw from the Soviet Union after defeating Japan, and within three months, they respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Northeast in the Soviet Union; Under the conditions of interference in the internal affairs of Xinjiang, it is allowed to decide whether to recognize the People’s Republic of Mongolia according to the result of a referendum on justice. Song Ziwen refused to sign and resigned from the post of Foreign Minister. Finally, the treaty was signed by Wang Shijie.",

Therefore, on August 24, the Legislative Yuan under the auspices of Sun Ke, with 95 people in favor, and four people opposed the adoption of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. On October 20th, a referendum was held in Mongolia, and the Chinese government sent a tour of Leifa. Lei Fazhang was enshrined in the life of Chiang Kai-shek and did not engage in any negotiations with the foreign authorities; regarding voting, Lei Fazhang should only observe carefully, but must not interfere or make any statement. Under the supervision of government personnel, the people of the outside Mongolia expressed their approval in the form of a public signature. The results of the vote showed that 100% of the citizens favored the independence of Mongolia from China. On November 15, 1945, the Soviet Union violated the treaty and refused to withdraw its troops from the Northeast. It supported the traitorous regime, that is, the pseudo-Northeast democratic government and the pseudo-military Northeastern coalition forces, and continued to exert pressure on China. At the end of 1945, Deputy Foreign Minister Losovsky made a comprehensive statement in his report to Stalin before Jiang Jingguo's visit to the Soviet Union: First, the Chinese government must recognize the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic; second, China must ensure the security along the Changchun Railway. It can be seen that Stalin has decided to go out. On January 5, 1946, the Republic of China recognized the independence of the People's Republic of Mongolia. Jiang Tingxi, a former representative of the Republic of China to the United Nations, believes that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance is too much the same as the Treaty of the Qing Dynasty. The treaty and the exchange of letters, on the whole, seem to be extremely beneficial to the Soviet Union. It can be said to be one-sided and unequal. If Russia and Russia strictly abide by this treaty and exchange letters, it will only benefit in Soviet Russia. Any fair researcher cannot avoid this conclusion. The evaluation of the referendum after the Lei Fazhang was: the person handling the voting affairs, the voting for the people, the guidance, the actual monitoring, and the strictness, this referendum is said to be the foreign Mongolian people’s desire to express their independence to the world. In fact, under the supervision of government officials, it is expressed in the form of a public signature, and it is difficult for the people to express their will to freedom. After the Chinese government of the Republic of China and the Soviet Union, the Government of the Republic of China expressed its doubts about the fairness of this vote when it met at the UN Security Council on August 27, 1947. The representative of the Republic of China, Jiang Tingyu, said: \"I believe that this matter is an excessively simple history that we cannot accept. When the time comes, the Chinese government has the right to engage in further observation.",

The job is to record the trade figures between countries, and the debts between countries, and preside over the formulation of international monetary and economic policies. As for the World Bank, it mainly provides long-term loans. The Bank's work is similar to that of investment banks, issuing bonds to companies, individuals or governments and lending the proceeds to recipient countries. The purpose of the IMF was to stabilize the currencies of countries and to monitor the foreign exchange market. Since the IMF is not a bank, it will not lend money. However, the International Monetary Fund has reserves for the state to borrow to stabilize the currency in a short period of time; the practice is similar to overdraft in current accounts. The loan must be repaid within 5 years. In July 1944, a United Nations-sponsored financial conference was held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USA. The main designer of the specific provisions of the International Monetary Fund is the US Deputy Treasury Secretary Henry Dickert White. Although John Maynard Keynes, head of the British delegation, strongly opposed the use of the US dollar as the sole substitute for gold in the IMF treaty, the countries finally signed an agreement to establish an international monetary fund at the meeting on July 22. . The terms of the agreement were implemented on December 27, 1945, and the International Monetary Fund was formally established as part of the post-World War II reconstruction plan. It officially opened on March 1, 1947. Sometimes the International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International Settlements and the World Bank are known as the Bretton Woods institutions. Almost all countries with market economies have their financial policies affected by these three institutions. Applications for joining the International Monetary Fund will first be considered by the board of directors of the fund. After that, the Board of Directors will submit a report on the membership resolution to the Governance Committee, which will recommend how many quotas and terms the applicant country can allocate in the fund. After the Governance Committee accepts the application, the country needs to amend the law, confirm the signed entry documents, and commit to comply with the rules of the fund. The quotas of member states determine the amount of contributions due to a country, the power of voting, the share of financial assistance, and the number of SDRs. No IMF membership is a member of the World Bank.",

The vast extent of the Rhine Valley also successfully captured the city of Rome during their heyday. Inhabited today in the Swiss territory is the Celtic Helvet tribe. The Germans, who were distributed in northern Europe around the BC, continued to expand into the Celtic settlement. In 70 BC, the Helvetic tribes who felt the pressure of the Germans decided to withdraw westward to the Atlantic coast southwest of Gaul, thus Caesar The rule of the Roman Empire borrowed; considering the potential threat of the Germans to the Roman Empire, Caesar decided to establish a Roman-controlled country in Switzerland. The Roman army not only did not agree to the Celtics' request for passage, but instead attacked them, forcing the latter to become the ally of the Roman Empire, and the Celts who were supported by the Roman Empire defeated the Germans who invaded the south. Caesar's successor, Augustus, merged the Helvet tribe into the imperial province. Today the scope of Switzerland is officially incorporated into the Roman Empire, and the local Celts began the Romanization era. During the Roman period in Rome, a Roman-style administrative system was established, and a series of cities were built to build the Empire Avenue leading to the Roman city. The Romans also introduced Switzerland's crops on the Mediterranean coast and the lifestyle of the Apennine peninsula, followed by Christianity. 100-250 years is the golden age of Rome, Switzerland, which ended with the invasion of the Empire by the Germans.",

The proposal was vetoed by the Queen, but Austria will face more enemies, and Frederick the Great was finally officially ceded in the 1742 Berlin Treaty. Austria unexpectedly counterattacked. In 1744, Frederick II again invaded Austria to prevent retaliation and asked Austria for the province of Bohemia. Prussia was defeated, but the pressure exerted by France on the Austrian ally, the British Empire, led to a series of treaties and compromises. Eventually, in 1748, Axel La Chapelle regained peace and allowed Prussian to retain most of Silesia. The dominion of the region.",

Denmark was defeated, but Prussia was forced to allow Denmark to maintain its status as a two-nation. In 1850, Frederick William IV promulgated the first constitution of the Kingdom of Prussia with his power. This is actually forced by the parliament. This document -- which was appropriate at the time but somewhat conservative under current standards -- has a bicameral parliament. The House of Commons, or state legislature, is elected by all taxpayers who are divided into three classes and have paid taxes to determine the weight of their votes. Women and people who do not pay taxes do not have the right to vote. This will allow only one-third of the people to choose 85 percent of the seats, but it will protect the rights of all men with a healthy economy. Soon after, it was renamed the Upper House of the Glorious House, and its members were appointed by the King. He retains great administrative power and the ministers are only responsible to him. Because of this, some aristocratic classes like Junker Landlords have also been retained, especially in the eastern provinces. Frederick William IV broke out in 1857, and his brother, Prince William, began to regent. Prince William pursued a more intermediate route and gained sufficient power after the death of Frederick William IV in 1861 and was crowned William I under his own right. However, shortly after he boarded the throne, he and the parliament clashed with the size of the army. The liberals who dominated the parliament rejected William’s request to increase the number of troops and detained the budget that was supposed to be allocated to the matter. Then the two sides fell into a deadlock, so William began to seriously consider whether to give up. He gave up, but he persuaded the parliament to appoint his French ambassador, Otto von Bismarck, as prime minister. Bismarck officially took office on September 23, 1862. Although Bismarck has the reputation of an indomitable conservative, he initially preferred to compromise on budget issues. However, William I was a bit cold about this. Bismarck came up with a new theory because he was forced to adopt a confrontational policy. According to the constitution, the king and the parliament are jointly responsible for the budget. Bismarck believes that since they have failed to reach an agreement, there must be a loophole in the parliament, and the government must follow the old budget and continue to collect taxes and pay funds to maintain operations. Therefore, the Prussian government could operate without a new budget between 1862 and 1866, and allowed Bismarck to carry out William's military reform.",

The Kingdom of Prussia is as dominant in the new empire as it was during the Northern German Confederation. His territory accounts for three-fifths of the entire empire, and the population accounts for two-thirds. The crown passed down by the Hohenzollern dynasty continued to be the crown of the empire. However, the difference between the Empire and the Prussian system is the source of problems in future affairs. The Empire has a system that allows men over the age of 25 to have equal voting rights. However, Prussia has retained a restrictive three-tier voting system, in which the voter power of the well-off voters is 17.5 times that of the general public. Since the Prime Minister of the Empire, in addition to the two presidencies of the Prussian Prime Minister, most of the other periods of the King / Emperor and Prime Minister / Prime Minister of Prussia have to be elected by the legislature, and the powers of the upper and lower Houses are completely different. When the empire was first established, about two-thirds of the population in Prussia and throughout Germany lived in the countryside. In just two decades, the situation has changed completely: the urban population accounts for two-thirds of the entire empire. However, whether in the Kingdom of Prussia or the entire empire, the constituency has never been reclassified by the population growth of the new town. This means that after the 1890s, rural areas had too much voting power. Bismarck realized that other European countries must be scrupulous about his powerful new empire, so he showed Germany's hot and peaceful peace at the Berlin conference. The New German Empire improved and strengthened its friendly relations with the United Kingdom. When the Crown Prince of Prussia, Frederick William, and Princess Victoria of Great Britain married in 1858, the link between London and Berlin was stamped with a gold stamp. William I died in 1888, and the Crown Prince was enthroned for Frederick III. The pro-British new emperor plans to turn Prussian and the entire empire along the British model into a more liberal and democratic constitutional monarchy. However, he died only 99 days after his reign, and then he was the 29-year-old eldest son, Wilhelm II. As a boy, William's efforts against his parents shaped him into a liberal school and thoroughly Prussian under the guidance of Bismarck. The relationship between the new emperor and the two kings of Britain and Russia deteriorated rapidly, and the two countries gradually became his opponents and eventually became enemies.",

          "context": "As the metal structure becomes the mainstream of the fighter design, the power of the various machine guns carried on the aircraft must also be increased to maintain the damage. There were several different types of use of fighters in the mid-1930s: machine guns with a larger number of rifle calibers, most of which were the same as the rifles or light machine guns used by the Army at the time. For example, the United Kingdom uses 8 0.30 inch machine guns. With a mix of light and heavy machine guns, the caliber of heavy machine guns is the same as that used by the Army. For example, the United States is matched with a 0.30 and 0.50 inch diameter. The machine gun is mixed with the rifle caliber machine gun, and the caliber of the machine gun is mostly 20 mm. For example, Germany and Japan are mixed with 20mm cannons and light machine guns. The machine gun is completely used as a weapon, and the caliber is 20 mm. Other relatively rare types include only one or two armed or heavy machine guns. Due to their low power, they are no longer considered after the war. The focus of the use of machine guns or machine guns in various countries lies in the weight of ammunition projected in the same period of time. This also creates two different styles: the use of a large number of light machine guns, because of the theoretical cycle of single machine guns. The speed is higher, and the number of warheads can be projected in the same shooting time, and the total weight is not low. However, the shortcoming is that the warhead itself has a low power, and it is even impossible to penetrate in the face of some protection designs, such as the famous Soviet heavy armor attack aircraft IL-2 and the American heavy bomber. A small number of cannons were used to increase the destructive power of each door. However, the cycle rate of the cannon was much slower than that of the light machine gun, and the amount of ammunition carried was also low. The pilot needs to use it cautiously so as not to use it too early. The recoil, weight and volume of the cannon also limit the location and number of installations. For example, in Japan, when the Ki-60 fighter was designed, the strength of the wing structure was insufficient and the problem of using the cannon had to be abandoned. Although the use of machine guns and machine guns can achieve the purpose of improving the destructive force and maintain a certain degree of firepower continuity, but because of the large difference in the ballistics between the machine gun and the machine gun, the aiming is difficult.",

Therefore, the relevant flight aids are installed at the airport and the aircraft to strengthen the night-time take-off and landing training, and replaced by multi-person and multi-engine models, including light bombers or dual-engine heavy fighters. The United Kingdom first installed radar on night fighters, and the special personnel operated and commanded the pilots to approach the target, and then attacked them within the visual range. Although Germany soon installed radar on their night fighters, the United Kingdom and the United States shared their R&D projects by working together to lead the country in the development of airborne radar. In addition to the P-61 fighters produced in the United States during the Second World War, the original design was not aimed at night flights, such as the German He 219 fighter and the British mosquito fighter, the Japanese moonlight night fighter, the Soviet Pe-3R and so on. The accumulated experience of use at the end of the war has made countries recognize that radar is not only capable of functioning at night, but also suitable equipment for long-distance or poorly-performing white space, thus contributing to the indispensable transformation of radar into a fighter.

In addition to being used as artillery observations and corrections during World War I, it is also used to perform patrols, bombings, attacks, and competition for air superiority. Fighters operating on a ship not only have the opportunity to engage in the same type of aircraft in the enemy camp, but also face-based aircraft, especially lighter fighters. In order to operate on the aircraft carrier, the structure of the carrier-based fighter needs to be strengthened, the weight will be heavier, and the performance will be slightly worse than that of the land-based fighters produced under similar technical and technological capabilities. This is a congenital disadvantage of the carrier-based aircraft, in order to avoid the performance gap. Too big, the design team must consider carefully so that the Navy's fighters are not at a disadvantage. Only Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States used a large number of carrier-based fighters during World War II. Among them, Japan and the United States conduct large-scale operations in the Pacific region with aviation forces on aircraft carriers, and are the only air superiority maintainers in the US Navy's amphibious landing operations. The limits of propeller performance in the 1930s have been understood in the experimental environment. The development of alternative thrusts has been carried out in many countries. Among them, Germany and the United Kingdom have developed faster. They developed the first generation of jet engines with their own technology and Let the jet fighters officially serve before the end of the World War. The United States mainly develops piston fighters. Although there are already many finished products in the country, they have not been put into mass production in order to concentrate wartime resources. The Soviet Union interrupted related research because of the war. In addition to a small amount of research results in Japan, Japan also uses data and samples from Germany to assist in development. Even if there were already jet fighters in service before the end of the war, the two sides did not have the opportunity to fight against the opponents. Until the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, the fighters and air combat types were completely transformed. After the Korean War, jet fighters quickly replaced propellers in various countries and became the first-line equipment. In addition to a few regional conflicts, such as football wars, fighting between jet fighters has become the norm.",

This day also marks the debut of the public service of the World Wide Web on the Internet. The key concept in the World Wide Web, Hypertext, originated from several previous projects in the 1960s. For example, Ted Nielsen's Sinna Project and Douglas Ingebat's NLS. The inspiration for both projects is based on the Memex system designed by Vannival Busch for microfilm in his 1945 paper \"Like Us.\" Another brilliant breakthrough of Tim Bernez-Lee is the grafting of hypertext to the Internet. In his book Weaving the Network, he explained that he repeatedly suggested to the members of the technical community that the combination of the two technologies was feasible, but no one accepted his suggestion. He finally had to solve this problem himself. plan. He invented three key technologies: a system that is uniquely authenticated by global network resources, and the Uniform Resource Identifier Hyper-File Markup Language Hypertext Transfer Protocol The World Wide Web and many other hypertext systems have many differences. Global Information Online requires a single connection rather than a two-way connection, which allows anyone to link the resource without any action by the resource owner. This is critical to reducing the difficulty of implementing web servers and web browsers compared to earlier network systems, but its side effect is the chronic problem of link failure. Unlike some application software such as HyperCard, World Wide Web is not proprietary, which allows servers and clients to independently develop and extend functionality without licensing restrictions. On April 30, 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web is free to anyone and does not charge any fees. Two months later, the Gopher agreement announced that it was no longer free to use, causing a large number of users to move from Gopher to the World Wide Web. The early popular web browsers were ViolaWWW for Unix and X Windows systems. Scholars generally believe that a turning point in the World Wide Web is the 1993 Mosaic web browser, a graphical interface browser developed by the National Supercomputer Application Center team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, by Mark Anderson. Lead development. Mosaic's development funds come from the US high-speed computing and communications program and the high-speed computing and communications bill, which is one of several computing development plans initiated by US Senator Al Gore. Before the release of Mosaic, images were usually not mixed with the text on the web, and the popularity of the World Wide Web was much lower than the old protocols used on the Internet, such as Gopher and WAIS. Mosaic's graphical user interface makes World Wide Web the most popular Internet protocol.",

Due to the development of the war situation, it is necessary to speed up the printing of the renminbi. For this reason, Nanhan Han also promptly invited the chairman of the then North China People's Government, Dong Biwu, to vote for the People's Bank of China. The title is a word. With the smooth progress of the Liberation War, the scattered liberated areas have quickly joined together. In order to adapt to the development of the situation, a unified currency is needed to replace the liberated area currencies of the original variety and inconvenient. In the second half of 1948, the preparatory office of the People's Bank of China reorganized the printing bank in the three major liberated areas of North China, Central China and Northwest China. On December 1, 1948, the People's Government of North China posted a notice to announce the establishment of the People's Bank of China. Nan Hanjun was appointed as the general manager of the People's Bank of China, and the deputy general manager was Hu Jingwei and Guan Xuewen. On the same day, the first batch of RMB was officially issued in the bank of Pingshan County, Hebei Province. Its number is 00000001; then, it is issued in Shijiazhuang with RMB 20 yuan and RMB 10 yuan. The first set of RMB has a gradual process from the initial launch to the circulation of the Chinese market. First, it stops using the Golden Coupon issued by the National Government. Secondly, it bans the circulation of gold, silver and foreign currency. At the same time, it gradually recovers the currency issued by each region and gradually recovers it according to the prescribed price. After the end of the Huaihai and Pingjin campaigns, the Battle of Dujiang was initiated. Four wild south passes through the Central Plains. The renminbi entered the national circulation market with the army and unified the national currency system. On March 10, 1949, the RMB was officially issued in the Central Plains Liberated Area. In February of the same year, a fleet of 30 or 40 large trucks was loaded with RMB for the use of the South Army to occupy Nanjing and Shanghai. On the second day after the escort of the renminbi arrived in Shanghai, they took over the Central Mint and the Central Printing Factory of the National Government. On the third day, they began to use the equipment and personnel there to print the renminbi. In December 1949, the former South of the South China Liberated Area The People's Bank of China was changed to the People's Bank of China South China Branch, and its branches were merged into the People's Bank of China system. The South African currency and other currencies of the South China Liberation Army Region were acquired at a fixed price. On July 23, 1950, the Hainan Military and Political Committee issued a notice announcing that the circulation of the votes issued by the Qiongya Revolutionary Base was stopped. The circulation area of the RMB has expanded to Hainan. In April 1951, the Northeast Bank and the Inner Mongolia People's Bank unified the People's Bank of China system, and the RMB became the currency of the Northeast and Inner Mongolia. At the end of 1951, the RMB became the currency of the Xinjiang region; from July 15, 1957, the RMB replaced the Tibetan currency. Become the home currency of Tibet.",

After inspecting at the grassroots level, he and Deng Xiaoping set up an emergency committee to propose 60 articles of agriculture and three to one package, and began to adjust the national economy and lead economic development from exaggerated idealism to pragmatism. Mao Zedong clearly felt that Liu and Deng had implemented a completely different political line from themselves, and their authority within the party was challenged. At the national work conference at the end of 1964, Mao Zedong criticized the four clear and five-reverse issues, and the two sides had fierce contradictions, which caused the relationship between Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and Mao Zedong to begin to burst. At the end of the same year, Liu Shaoqi attended the first meeting of the Third National People's Congress, was re-elected as the President of the People's Republic of China, and served as Chairman of the National Defense Commission. During the three-year famine period, Zhongnanhai had implemented a system of self-reported rations for senior cadres. At that time, Mao Zedong and Zhu De reported 13 kilograms per month, Zhou Enlai was 12 kilograms per month, and Liu Shaoqi was 9 kilograms per month. Liu is the least reported among all cadres in Zhongnanhai. Mao Zedong re-examined the class struggle in 1962, criticizing the dark winds in the CCP, turning the case, and the wind. The three winds are more or less related to Liu Shaoqi. Liu Shaoqi accepted Mao Zedong's anti-repair and anti-repair theory. He not only made self-criticism, but also severely accused the three winds. He also said that the question of who is winning and losing the two classes has not yet been resolved. It is necessary to strengthen socialist education and prepare for capitalist restoration. However, at this time, Liu Shaoqi did not regard capitalist restoration as a real danger. The object of class struggle he said at that time was only speculative, corruption and theft, as well as some serious extravagance and waste, serious degeneration and corruption, and illegal and chaotic. A social problem such as serious dispersalism has a clear distance from Mao Zedong’s understanding of the seriousness of class struggle. Since September 1963, the debate between the CCP and the CPSU has been fully carried out. Under the background of international anti-repair and key domestic defense, Liu Shaoqi began to shift his energy to the socialist education movement that is being rolled out. Liu Shaoqi presided over the revision of the \"Last Ten Articles\", which was approved by Mao Zedong and together with the \"Top Ten Articles\" to reach the entire people. The Siqing Movement was launched in an all-round way. With the progress of the movement, Liu Shaoqi’s understanding of the socialist education movement has also undergone major changes. He accepted Mao Zedong’s theory of anti-repair and defense, and considered revisionism to be a bourgeois ideology and a bourgeois ideology in society.

On the evening of the 3rd, under the instructions of Sakamoto and other officials, the rebel group first approved Liu Shaoqi and Wang Guangmei.

On August 22 of the same year, at the entrance of Fengtian Yarn Factory, he was arrested for suspicion of a strike. In mid-September, he was sentenced by the Fengtian High Court. The evidence was insufficient and he was not prosecuted. In the future, Liu Shaoqi became an important evidence of the traitor, that is, he was arrested. In the summer of 1930, Liu Shaoqi went to Moscow to attend the Fifth Congress of Red Workers International and was elected as a member of the Executive Board. In January 1931, Liu Shaoqi was elected as an alternate member of the Politburo at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In September 1931, after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was executed to Zhongfa, the Provisional Central Committee was established. The Provisional Central Political Bureau consisted of nine members including Bogu, Zhang Wentian, Lu Futan, Li Zhusheng, Kang Sheng, Chen Yun, Huang Ping, Liu Shaoqi and Wang Yuncheng. In the winter of the same year, Liu Shaoqi returned to China and served as Secretary of the Party Central Committee and Secretary of the National Federation of Trade Unions. In 1932, Liu Shaoqi served as secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee. In the winter of 1932, Liu Shaoqi entered the Central Soviet Area and led the staff movement. In January 1934, at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Liu Shaoqi was elected as the secretary of the first CPC Fujian Provincial Committee. In October of the same year, he participated in the Long March and served as the leader of the Red Eight Army. Later, due to the defeat of the war, the Red Eight Army Corps was abolished and replaced by the Red Five Army. In 1935, Liu Shaoqi attended the Zunyi Conference, which was one of Mao Zedong's staunch supporters. Since then, Liu has served as the director of the Political Department of the Red Three Army. In October of the same year, Liu Shaoqi and Xie Fei got married and arrived in northern Shaanxi at the end of the year. They served as chairman of the Northwest Executive Board of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. In December, Liu Shaoqi attended the Wa Yaobao meeting. In 1936, Liu Shaoqi went to Tianjin to serve as secretary of the Northern Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, leading the CCP's anti-Japanese movement in Shanxi, Hebei, Tianjin, and Beijing, and engaging with the Kuomintang political circles, the military, and students. Liu adopted Ke Qingshi’s proposal and requested from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to recommend that the members of the Communist Party of China who were detained by the National Government in the Caozizi Introspection’s Court fulfilled the simple procedures of the prison authorities and did not publish the rules. Zhang Wentian’s proposal on behalf of the CPC Central Committee approved Liu’s proposal. . About 60 members of the Communist Party of China who were detained in the anti-provincial court received instructions from Liu, drafted the \"Anti-Communist Notice\" and released it after being published. The CCP members who were released from prison have made important contributions to the opening of the situation in the Northern Bureau.

It is able to gain freedom in the Earth's gravitational field, and the escape velocity into the interplanetary space is about 11,000 km / h. The energy required to enter the low Earth orbit is 32 MJ / kg. The energy required to climb to the same height is 10 kJ. 20 times /km·kg. Sub-orbital flight and orbital flight have major differences. The lowest orbit around the Earth is 350 km above sea level. The common misconception is that the orbit is only at this height to reach the boundary of space. In theory, the required orbital velocity can be obtained at any height, but the atmospheric drag eliminates the orbits that are too low in height. As long as there is enough speed, the aircraft can also enter the orbit, but at present, this speed is several times faster than the current technology can achieve. Another common misconception is that people on the track are outside the gravitational pull of the Earth because they are floating. They float because they are free-falling: they are accelerating to the Earth along with space vehicles, but at the same time they are moving away from the straight path at a fast enough speed to keep them at a constant distance on the surface of the Earth. The gravitational pull of the Earth far exceeds the Van Allen Belt and keeps the Moon in an orbit of 384,403 kilometers above the Earth. Space is not a perfect vacuum: different regions are defined by different atmospheres and winds, and they dominate those regions, and the wind expands beyond the originally defined region. Earth's space extends from the Earth's atmosphere to the Earth's magnetosphere, making it distinct from the interplanetary space of the solar wind.

Geospatial areas include areas above the atmosphere, such as the ionosphere and magnetosphere, and the Van Allen radiation belt is also in the Earth's space. The area between the Earth's atmosphere and the moon is sometimes referred to as the Earth's Moon space. Although it satisfies the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density within a few hundred kilometers above the Carmen line can still cause sufficient resistance to the satellite. Many satellites operate in this area known as low-Earth orbit, and every few days they need to start their engines to maintain orbit. Although the resistance here is very low, it is theoretically enough to surpass the radiation pressure of the solar sail, which is a propulsion system recommended by interplanetary travel. The density of charged particles stuffed in Earth's space is very low, and their motion is controlled by the Earth's magnetic field. These materials formed by the plasma are disturbed by the solar storm, and the current flowing to the upper atmosphere of the Earth is driven by the solar wind. When magnetic storms occur in two regions of the Earth's space, the radiating zone and the ionosphere cause strong disturbances. The increased flow of high-energy electrons caused by these storms can cause permanent damage to the circuits on the satellite. Disturbing telecommunications and GPS technology, and even astronauts in low Earth orbit will be harmed. They also create aurora near the Earth's magnetic poles. Earth's space also contains many of the remains of previously launched manned or unmanned space vehicles, potentially damaging the subsequent space vehicles. Some debris will return to Earth's atmosphere after a period of time. The lack of air in the Earth's space is an ideal place for astronomers to observe all the electromagnetic spectrum. The wonderful pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope are visible, allowing light from 13.7 billion years ago - almost the period of the big bang - to be observed. The upper boundary of the Earth's space is the interface between the magnetosphere and the solar wind, and the inner boundary is the ionosphere. In other words, the Earth's space is the outer space between the upper layer of the Earth's atmosphere and the outermost side of the Earth's magnetic field.",

          "context": "Scottish engineer John Rogi Baird began working with the BBC in 1932 to try TV broadcasts. On November 2, 1936, the BBC began the world's first television broadcast service. Television broadcasting was interrupted in World War II, but re-launched in 1946. On June 2, 1953, the BBC broadcast lively the Elizabethan ceremony at Westminster Abbey. It is estimated that about 20 million people across the UK directly witnessed the scene of the Queen's accession to the throne. Due to the challenge of underground radio stations, on September 30, 1967, the BBC began the BBC Radio 1 radio service to broadcast popular music. In 1983, the BBC first broadcasted the breakfast time broadcast service \"BBC Breakfast\", which was ahead of the competition. In 1991, the BBC officially started the BBC Global News Service TV channel, and later changed its name to BBC World in January 1995. Unlike the BBC Global Radio Service, the BBC Global News Service is a commercial television station that monetizes advertising, which means that the channel cannot be broadcast in the UK. In August 1998, the BBC's domestic channel began to use satellite broadcasts; an unexpected result of this was that as long as European viewers used British-made satellite decoders, they could also watch BBC1 and BBC2. On November 11, 2012, the former chief executive of the BBC, George Entwist, was reported to have resigned when he was reported to have reported a sexual assault on children, misrepresenting a scandal involving a senior Conservative Party member. By Tony Hull, he was appointed as the chief executive officer and became the shortest-serving president when he took office on September 17, 2012. The BBC's Royal Charter expired in 2006. The review of the Royal Charter is in progress. On March 2, 2005, Culture Minister Liu Jiahui published a green paper on the long-term development of the BBC. The main point of the Green Paper is to maintain the licensing system until the abolition of the BBC Board of Directors in 2016, to replace the BBC Foundation and increase the outsourcing of program production, reduce the emphasis on viewing and copy the concept of the program.",

The official name is the same as that of the Eastern Roman Empire. It used the Roman republics and the Roman people. The empire finally fell in 480 years when the Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno was replaced by the King of Italy. But during this period, the Western Roman Empire was insignificant. . The position of the emperor of the Western Roman Empire existed intermittently between the 3rd and 5th centuries. With the establishment of the four emperors established by Diocletian, Emperor Constantine and Yuli Anzun reunited Rome after the Byzantine court, but in After the death of Theodosius I in 395, he divided the empire into two sons. After eighty-five years, Zeno recognized the fact that the Western Roman Empire died, so after the death of the Western Roman Emperor Nibos, he was enshrined. The monk Diodoric was the king of Italy. After Odojas took control of Italy's entire territory in 476, historian Edward Gibbon set the demise of the Western Roman Empire on September 4, 476. Emperor Romulus Augustus was Odousase. At the time of the retreat of the Emperor, or after the death of Emperor Nibos in 480 AD, due to the great influence of the Roman Empire in European history, when the Western Roman Empire died in 476 AD, it was generally divided into the end of ancient Europe.

When the war broke out, the generals leading the army usually had more than the peacetime. In order to ensure the loyalty of the commanders, they would take their family as hostages. Finally, Nero controlled Tumitan and Kuntus, who were respectively The son of Spartan and his brother-in-law, Nero ruled only the last remaining Guards and uprising, so that Nero’s throne could only fall into the hands of Servius Surpigius Garba. The most commonly cited whistle of the Guards is that the sword of Damocles is also seen as a representative of loyalty, and it is thus known that the legions of the frontiers often join the civil war. The main enemy of the Western Roman Empire was the Germans, whose land was on the banks of the vast Rhine and the Danube. Octavian was subjected to the tenacious resistance of the local Germans in the eastern expansion of the 9th year of the AD. As a result, the Roman legions were almost completely wiped out during the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. The rest of the empire in the East became the enemy on the other side. The country was far away and the national power was so strong that it was not conquered. Every invasion of the Resting Empire was repelled. The rest of the world defeated the Roman offensive every time, but there were also a few records of victory. For example, Trajan, however, these new territories that are too far from Rome can only give up in the end to ensure peace with rest. It is easier to control the western territory of the original Roman Empire, because the Germans are not united like rest, and it is difficult to control anyway when there is a war on both sides. If the emperor is in the east, of course, the control of the area is stronger. However, the West is weaker, and vice versa.

In the face of a strong opponent - the Kingdom of West Goth, plus the Western Roman Empire, the Attila attacked the Gaul area, the famous Salon battle broke out on both sides, although the Gothic-Roman coalition victory, but the West God King Diodoric But killed. Although the Hungarians withdrew from Gaul because of the defeat, Attila quickly went straight to Italy and Pope Leo I came forward. In 453, Attila died, leaving a huge empire divided by his successor and eventually disappeared into the stage of history. However, the turmoil did not stop. In 455, the Vandals captured Rome, and Leo once again came forward to mediate. Most barbarians were exempted from being killed by the Hungarians under the protection of Western Rome. In the 1950s, the Germans invaded Western Romans. In the next two decades, the emperors of Western Rome were constantly captured, expelled or led by barbarian leaders. It was a shackle, from Valentinian, who was exiled by Attila, to the last emperor Nipos, and the barbarian leader even propped his son to the emperor. In 475, Oreste ousted the Western Roman Emperor Nibos and helped his son Romulus Augustus to be the Western Roman Emperor. In 476, Odo Ayase killed Oreste, dethroned Romulus Augustus, and became a king of Italy, which also symbolized the fall of the Western Roman Empire. After 476 years, three parallel governments emerged, and the following forces claimed to be the Western Roman orthodox government: the exiled emperor Nipos, who controlled Dalmatia until 480 years of murder; The governor remained loyal to Rome until his death in 487; the Roman-Aran Province of North Africa, which also surrendered to the Vandals, until 534, when Byzantine defeated the Vandals, he returned to the jurisdiction of East Rome. The Western Roman Empire generally recognized the date of demise on September 4, 476, and Odo Ayase ousted Romulus Augustus, but the lack of specific historical materials made the details still a mystery. Nibos still claimed to be the Western Roman emperor, and there was an insignificant territory left, and he had a considerable relationship with the Emperor Zeno of the Byzantine Empire. There was also an enclave in the north of Gaul and still loyal to Rome. Odo Ayase loyal to Juno after the leader of the self-proclaimed Italian, Juno also enshrined him to recognize the legality of Odo Yasai, but Odo Yasei still respected Nebos as the emperor of West Rome, in Italy. The currency is still the portrait and name of Nipos, but the authority of the royal family has long been worse than before, and there is no possibility of resuming rule. Odo Yasei continued to hold power in the territory until the assassination of Nebos in 480 years. Legitimacy was completely replaced by the Italian kingdom of Odoyase.",

          "context": "The second basis is from the Norwegian historian Huni Slagstad, who claimed to be able to prove that he had said that the existence was borrowed from Welhaven. He strongly believes that Zucker himself has said that Hegel's method does not study philosophy in a existential way; it uses the words that I used to talk about in philosophy with Welhaven. On the other hand, the Norwegian historian Anne-Lisser expressed doubts about Slegstad's argument that the statement actually originated from Norwegian literary historian Kaslinu Pon. Its most famous and clearest initiative is Jean-Paul Saudi's maxim: existence precedes essence. What he means is that there is no moral or soul that is justified except for the survival of man. Morality and soul are created by people in their lives. People are not obliged to obey certain moral standards or religious beliefs, but they have freedom of choice. To evaluate a person, evaluate what he is doing, not to evaluate who he is, because a person is defined by his actions. Saudi Arabia denies the existence of God or any other predefined rules. Jean-Paul Saudis opposes any factor of rebellion in life because they narrow the room for human freedom of choice. If there is no such resistance, then the only problem that a person has to solve is which one he chooses to go. However, man is free; even if he is deceiving himself, there is still potential and possibility. Saudi Arabia also suggested that others are hell. This view seems to contradict the free view of people's choice. In fact, everyone's choice is free, but for the result of the choice, each person has the responsibility that cannot be evaded, and the biggest problem that people face in the process of choice. It is the choice of others, because everyone has the freedom to choose, but the freedom of each person may affect the freedom of others, so calling others is hell. Existentialism does not deny the existence of God. For example, Zucker is a Christian. He believes that existentialism is the beginning of the Christian mode of thinking. Nietzsche stated in his book Happy Science that God is dead. Nietzsche does not mean that God is dead at the metaphysical level; on the contrary, Nietzsche understands that God has died in a crisis of moral standards.",

          "context": "Geometric optics, also known as ray optics, describes the propagation of light. In geometric optics, light is called a ray. Light changes the direction of propagation at the interface of two different media, and it is possible to bend the curve in a medium whose refractive index changes with position. The light in geometric optics is an abstract object whose direction of travel is perpendicular to the wavefront of the light wave. Geometric optics gives the law of the propagation of light through an optical system to predict the position of its actual wavefront. The Fermat principle is the basic theorem of geometric optics: the path of light propagation is the path through which light passes in the shortest time, from which many laws of geometric optics can be derived. Consider an optical system composed of a lens, a mirror and a cymbal. Geometric optics can be used to illustrate the reflection, refraction, etc. It should be noted that geometric optics simplifies the optical theory, so it cannot explain many important optics. Effects such as diffraction, polarization, etc. Geometrical optics can be further simplified by paraxial approximation and correspond to linearization in mathematical descriptions. Under paraxial approximation conditions, optical components and systems can be represented by a simple matrix. Both Gaussian optics and paraxial ray tracing are developed on the basis of a paraxial approximation to determine the first-order properties of the optical system, such as finding the imaging position, the position of the object, and the approximation of the magnification. Gaussian beam propagation is an extension of paraxial optics that more accurately describes coherent propagation. Even if a paraxial approximation is still used, this technique can partially describe the diffraction, and can accurately calculate the rate at which the laser beam travels with distance and its minimum convergence size. Gaussian beam propagation theory can therefore communicate geometric optics and physical optics.",

It was founded on May 15, 1878, and began trading on June 1 of the same year. It was founded at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The transaction was suspended during the Second World War, reopened on May 16, 1949, and renamed the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The trading floor of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed on April 30, 1999, all changed to electronic trading, and the new TSE Arrows was launched on May 9, 2000. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is the second largest stock exchange in the world, but it is not a large international financing center. There are quite a few overseas companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, mainly Japanese companies, and other international companies such as New York. Sexual stock exchanges have a large number of foreign companies. In 2000, the Hiroshima Stock Exchange and the Niigata Stock Exchange were merged into the Tokyo Stock Exchange. On November 20, 2012, two major stock exchanges, the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Stock Exchange, held a press conference to announce that the two stock exchanges will be merged on January 1, 2013 to form the Japan Exchange Group. The stock market of the two exchanges will be operated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange from July 2013, and the two financial derivatives markets will be completed by March 2014 and will be operated by the Osaka Stock Exchange. It is estimated that as of the end of October 2012, the total market capitalization of listed companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Stock Exchange ranked fourth in the world. The Japan Exchange Group was listed on the Main Board of the East China Exchange on January 4, 2013.",

          "context": "Today, the tooth-making has become the most popular processing method for the edge of the stamp, which also makes the unique shape of the stamp. The teeth on the edge of the stamp are actually the modern style of stamp punching. At the beginning, the edge of the stamp will not be processed. Without teeth, the user needs to use scissors to separate from the stamp square. The British Henry Arthur intends to improve the situation. He first applied a puncher with a small knife row that people could use to make an isometric cut between two stamps. The first stamp in the world produced in this way appeared in 1848. Henry Asher did not stop there, he continued to improve the machine, and later used the core to replace the knife. This method is very popular. When the first edge-toothed stamp appeared in the UK, countries around the world followed suit. After the invention of the puncher, most of the stamps were perforated, but sometimes there were no perforations because of the lack of punching conditions. The value of such stamp collections is generally higher than that of perforated stamps. Sometimes the postal department deliberately issues non-perforated stamps in order to meet the needs of stamp collectors. For example, the People’s Republic of China issued the stamp No. 94 issued on August 8, 1962. Fang Stage Art and the special 59th Panda released on August 5, 1963. The back of the stamp will be glued, and then the surface will be sticky as long as it wets the surface and can be applied to the surface of the envelope. From now on, the stamp will be glued on the machine before printing. But in the early days, it was first printed and glued, and before the corresponding machine appeared, the glue was hand-brushed. The main component of the glue is a plastic, such as polyvinyl alcohol, which is a carbon polymer. Later it was an animal adhesive, as well as plant adhesives such as dextrin or gum arabic. Some post offices have begun to apply sticky plastic films. Most users use the tongue to wet the glue layer, so many post offices want to make the stamps taste. For example, Demail tested mint-coated rubber materials from 1955 to 1956. Some stamps use stickers as glue, such as the special stamp of the National Flag of the People's Republic of China issued in 2004 and the international postage stamp issued in the United States in 2013.",

          "context": "The papers of stamps are specially made, and they must meet the technical requirements. They must be effective for anti-counterfeiting identification, and they must be made in an orderly manner, so they are expensive. The paper used in today's stamps will shine. The nature of this efficacy gain of fluorescent, phosphorescent and postage stamps is different. The illuminating nature of the stamp is on the one hand anti-counterfeiting, on the other hand the automatic stamping machine relies on it to identify the stamping position. Germany needs 25 tons of stamp paper per day. Many other countries use wood or cloth stamps. For example, Switzerland has issued these stamps but only faces collectors. Bhutan, which issued stamps in 1955, issued a set of 68 to 100 mm record stamps on April 15, 1973. They are both stamps and records. The Soviet Union printed two aviation-themed aluminum stamps in 1965. East Germany issued a polyester stamp in 1963, because the word Dederon is very close in pronunciation to the German acronym DDR of East Germany. On the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Burundi issued a gold film stamp to commemorate its independence. In 2003, Italy issued a jeans stamp. 2004 Swiss issue of wood stamps. On June 21, 2000, Switzerland also issued the world's first set of embroidery stamps. But in the final analysis, paper is still the most practical material for stamps. The stamp paper for the Hong Kong Rare Plant Special Stamps issued in Hong Kong on August 17, 2017 was printed on the Forest Stewardship Council certified paper. Many countries use stamps to promote themselves. The stamps range from the portraits of the early monarchs to the current diversity of things such as culture, plants, technology, sports, architecture, art, celebrities and events. The issuance and design of stamps in countries around the world are extremely strict. On December 7, 1999, the General Post Office of China established the first stamp selection advisory committee to be responsible for the topic selection of stamps. The German stamp was issued by the German Finance Agency in cooperation with a planning advisory group called the German Post Art Group. The stamp designer needs to magnify the design six times to show all the details. The design of stamps is not without taboos. In the United States, commemorative stamps cannot be issued for religious people. The president can only issue commemorative stamps on his birthday after his death. The design of the stamp is not an official work and is therefore protected by copyright. The copyright belongs to the post office where the stamp is issued, but the content of the stamp is acceptable. If the copying act does not involve the whole picture of the stamp, but it is obviously copying the part, it touches the copyright law. Countries around the world react differently to the posting of stamps on books or websites. For example, the Faroe Islands are illustrations that allow others to make a full picture of their stamps. In Germany, this behavior is limited: it requires 25% or less of the original image, or a slash at the corner. The latter is accepted by most countries in the world.",

It is connected to Tennessee in the north, Georgia in the east, Florida and Gulf of Mexico in the south, and Mississippi in the west. Alabama is the 30th largest in the state and the 24th largest in the state. Alabama's inland waterways are 1,500 miles long and the longest of all states. Alabama is known as the Golden Woodpecker State, whose name comes from the state bird. At the same time, Alabama is known as the heart of Dixie and the state of cotton. The state tree is long-leaved pine, while the state flower is camellia. The state of Alabama is located in Montgomery. The largest city by population is Birmingham, which has long been the most industrialized city in the state; the largest city by area is Huntsville. The oldest city was Mobile, founded in 1702 by French colonists as the capital of French Louisiana. From the Civil War to the Second World War, Alabama suffered economic hardships as other southern states, one of which was the long-term dependence on agricultural products. Like other southern states, Alabama lawmakers deprived African Americans and many poor whites of their way into the twentieth century. Despite the rapid development of the industrial and metropolitan areas, whites have monopolized suburban interests from 1901 to the 1960s, and urban interests and the representation of African Americans are seriously inadequate. After the Second World War, Alabama diversified its economy from staple agriculture. The 21st century state economy is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, refining minerals, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.",

The northern Alabama region is mountainous, while the Tennessee River cuts out large river valleys and creates countless streams, streams, rivers, mountains and lakes. Alabama is adjacent to Tennessee in the north, Georgia in the east, Florida in the south, and Mississippi in the west. Alabama has a coastline in the Gulf of Mexico, the southernmost part of the state. The state's elevation ranges from the sea level of Mobile Bay to the more than 1,800-mile Appalachian Mountains to the northeast. The highest point is located in Cheha Mountain, which is 2413 miles high. Alabama's land includes 22 million acres of forest, accounting for 67% of the state's land. Baldwin County on the outskirts of the city is the largest county in the state, including land area and water area. Areas under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service in Alabama include the Horseshoe Bay National Military Park near Alexandria, the Little Valley National Conservation Area near Fort Payne, the Russell Cave National Monument in Bridgeport, and the Tower of Tuskegee The National Historic Site of the Skigit Pilot and the National Historic Site of the Tuskegee College near Tuskegee. In addition, Alabama has four national forests: Konica, Talladega, Tuskegee, and William B. Bankhead. Alabama also has the Natchez Trail Road, the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail and the National History Trail of the Blood and Tears. One of Alabama's natural wonders is the natural bridge rock, the longest natural arch east of the Rocky Mountains, south of Herliville. There is a 5 inch wide meteorite impact at Elmore County, north of Montgomery. This is the Wilhelm Crater, the largest natural disaster in Alabama. A 1000-mile-wide meteorite hit the area 80 million years ago.

          "context": "The galaxy, or translated as the Milky Way, is derived from the Greek language. In a broad sense, galaxies refer to the operating systems of numerous galaxies and dust. Reference to our Milky Way is a massive system of stars, clusters, nebulae, interstellar matter, cosmic dust and dark matter that is bound by gravity, usually at distances of millions of light years. The galaxies have an average of tens of billions of stars, which are the basic units that make up the universe. Typical galaxies, from dwarf galaxies with tens of millions of stars to elliptical galaxies with tens of thousands of stars, all run around the center of mass. In addition to individual stars and thin interstellar matter, most galaxies have a large number of multi-star systems, clusters, and various nebulae. Historically, galaxies were classified according to their shape. The most common is the elliptical galaxy, which has a bright appearance with an elliptical shape; the spiral galaxy is the shape of a disc, plus a curved dust vortex arm; irregular or abnormal shapes are usually the result of being influenced by other nearby galaxies. The interaction between adjacent galaxies may lead to the merging of galaxies or the massive production of stars, becoming so-called starburst galaxies. Small galaxies lacking a structured structure are called irregular galaxies. In the visible universe that can be seen, the total number of galaxies may exceed 100 billion. Most galaxies are between 1,000 and 100,000 seconds in diameter, and the distance between them is on the order of a millionth of a second. The intergalactic space is filled with extremely thin plasma with an average density of less than one atom per cubic meter. Most galaxies are organized into larger groups that become galaxies or groups that aggregate into larger superclusters. These larger groups are often referred to as flakes or fibers, surrounding a huge void in the universe. Although we have little knowledge of dark matter, it accounts for about 90% of the mass in most galaxies. Observed data show that supermassive black holes exist in the core of the galaxy, if not all, and they account for the vast majority. They are considered to be the main cause of some galaxies with active cores. The Milky Way, our planet and the galaxy in which the solar system is located, seems to hide at least one such object in the core.",

In the broad sense, Manchuria will also include the Manchuria, which is the area south of the Wai Xing'an Mountains. The area of Manchuria in the traditional sense is about 830,000 square miles, which is larger than the combined total of Western European countries such as France, Britain and Ireland, Germany, Italy and Spain. Although the name of Manchuria is named after the Manchurian family, it is only explained as a tribal name in Manchu, and there is no meaning of place names. Manchuria was first used as a place name in the book \"Japanese Border Sea Sketch\" by Japanese scholar Takahashi Kenzo. It was not until the end of the 19th century that Western powers, especially the Russian imperialist powers extended to this point, and the significance of Manchuria as a place name began to stand out. Since then, Russia and Japan have become familiar with the world. However, the Qing government still uses the three provinces to call this area in formal occasions. For example, in 1902, the Sino-Russian Treaty on the Settlement of the Three Eastern Provinces and the Treaty on the Third East Province of the China-Japan Conference in 1905 were all referred to in the three eastern provinces. After the Second World War, newspapers in the CCP-controlled area, such as the \"Dongbei Daily\", used the vocabulary of the North Manchurian, the South Manchu, and the East Manchu in the Manchuria period to be used in the northeast, northeast, and northeast. east. The CCP and the military region set up the East, South, West, and North Bureaus and the East, South, West, and North Manchu Districts. To modern times, the people of Liao, Kyrgyzstan and Black are still used. For example, the older generation used to call the northern part of Manchuria as Beiman. Nowadays, in China, the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang in the Manchuria region are generally used in the northeast, northeastern three provinces, the three eastern provinces or the Kanto region, but sometimes the northeast also includes the northeastern part of Inner Mongolia. At present, the Manchus in the northeastern region do not account for the majority of the population, and Manchuria has rarely been used as a place name, especially the official; because the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Pu Yi, established the Manchurian state controlled by the Japanese army, and was widely regarded by the Chinese as the Japanese empire that invaded China. The embarrassment, the word Manchuria will make some people first think of the word pseudo-full, not Manchu or Manchuria. Chinese officials still use the term Manchuria in terms of historical terminology, such as cultural relics such as the former site of the Manchurian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, exclusive names such as Manzhouli City, and some enterprises such as Beiman Special Steel. In countries such as South Korea, North Korea, Japan, and Russia, which are close to Manchuria and other countries in the world, Manchuria is still very common as a geographical name.",

During the Warring States Period, Yanzhao Wang hit Donghu, and the land was thousands of miles away. The Liaoning area began to return to China, and after the Qin unified China, Liaodong County was established. The two Han Dynasty set up Liaodong County in western Liaoning. In addition, Zuobeiping County had some Liaodong, and in the Eastern Han Dynasty, Sima Yi was arbitrarily divided. In Pingzhou, the Western Jin Dynasty, the Xianbei people established the former Yan and the Houyan here, and were annexed by Goguryeo. After the Tang dynasty Goguryeo, Liaodong returned to China, and in the north it established the Bohai State, and later belonged to the regime established by the Khitan, Jurchen and Mongolian tribes. At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, the Hongwu Northern Expedition descended from the Naha, and retired from Li Chenggui, and recovered from Liaodong. Because of its borders and the system of the guards, the commander of the commander was appointed, and the Shandong Buzheng ambassador was placed in the Liao, and the people of Shanxi were filled. During the Yongle period, the establishment of the institutions of slavery and cadres in the lower reaches of Heilongjiang and Wusuli Rivers, and the southern part of the territory were autonomous Jurchen settlements. At that time, there were Jianzhou Jurchen, Haixi Jurchen and Savage Jurchen. In the 15th century, North Korea attacked the Jurchen, annexed the area south of the Tumen River, and established four counties and six towns. In the middle of the 16th century, the Jianzhou Jurchen Department began to rise, gradually unifying the Jurchen ministries and developing into the later post-Golden regime. At the beginning of the establishment of Houjin, the soldiers were opposed to the seven hates, and the Chongzhen season has controlled the entire Liaodong, and even established the Qing Dynasty into the Central Plains. From the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century, the name Manchuria was used by Europeans to refer to the residence of the Manchurian nation, so the term began to be both the name of the region and the nation. In the geographical sense, Manchuria usually refers to the whole provinces of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang, plus the northeastern part of Inner Mongolia. According to the Sino-Russian Treaty of Nybchu in 1689, the Sino-Russian Treaty of Bryans in 1727, and the demarcation agreement with North Korea in 1712, the history of Manchuria also includes the outer Manchuria, which is today east of the Ussuri River. It is north of Heilongjiang and south of the Xing'an Mountains, with a total area of more than 2.2 million square kilometers. In the early years of the Qing Dynasty, General Sheng Jing, General Jilin and General Heilongjiang were set up in Manchuria. Manchuria differed from Guanzhong in terms of management methods, administrative systems and land tenure. After the Sino-Russian Battle of Jacques, the Qing Dynasty began sending the Eight Banners and the Eight Banners Han Army immigrants to Manchuria in 1692. Ningguta, which is under the jurisdiction of General Jilin, was a famous exile in the Qing Dynasty. Since Manchuria was the birthplace of the Qing Dynasty, the Qing soldiers took bans on the area after entering the customs, built wicker borders, and prohibited Han immigrants from entering their hinterland. However, throughout the 18th century, the Qing government was increasingly uncertain, sometimes blocking immigrants, and sometimes did not know the Han people infiltrated into the wicker.",

          "context": "Baroque art is an artistic style in Europe in the 17th century. It uses exaggerated movement and clear and discernible details to create drama, tension, cumbersomeness and grandeur in the fields of sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance and music. This style originated in Rome in Italy around 1600 and was later spread to most parts of Europe. The popularity and success of the Baroque style is related to the encouragement of the Roman Catholic Church. In response to the rise of religious reforms at the time, the church decided at the Trento meeting that art should express religious themes directly and emotionally. The aristocrats at the time considered the dramatic Baroque architecture and art to be a means of dumping their guests and expressing victory, power and control. The Baroque palace with its vestibule, grand staircase and luxurious reception room was built. There are many different sources of the word Baroque. One comes from Portuguese or Spanish, meaning irregular beads. As an adjective, this word has a vulgar meaning. The Europeans originally used this term to refer to works that lacked the balance of classicism; another said that it came from Italian, with strange, quirky or inferentially wrong meanings. But in fact the original source is not certain. In general, it was originally a person who admired classical art in the 18th century. It is a derogatory term different from the Renaissance style in the 17th century. Today the word has lost its original derogatory meaning, referring only to a kind of 17th century popular in Europe. Art style. Although Baroque refers to art works that lack classical balance, in fact, Baroque artists, like the predecessors of the Renaissance, attach great importance to the overall unity of design and effect. The Baroque style is characterized by emphasis on movement and transformation, especially body and mood. On the one hand, at the same time, Baroque is also a reaction to the doctrine. In the history of European culture, Baroque used to refer to the 17th century and the first half of the 18th century, but the vintage does not represent absolute artistic style, especially architecture and music. During this period, the Renaissance was followed by neoclassical and romantic times. In addition to the old ones, European culture has undergone major changes and achievements in all aspects. With the rise of the bourgeoisie, the monarchy is gradually becoming independent of religion. Science began under the inception of Galileo, Newton and others. The artistic trend is secular, energetic, innovative, and even great. Famous artists such as Shakespeare and Cervantes; Rubens and Rembrandt on the paintings have far-reaching influence. During this period, Europe expanded its colonization outwards and gradually occupied the center of world civilization.",

There was even a poem that satirized Mencius: Why did you have a second wife? There are many chickens in the neighboring house? When fashion has Zhou Tianzi, what happened to Wei Qi? . Since the Tang Dynasty, Han Yu’s \"Original Road\" has listed Mencius as the only person in the Confucian pre-Qin Confucianism to inherit the Confucius Taoism. There has been a Mencius promotion movement, and the status of Mencius’s book has gradually increased, replacing Yan Hui as Yasheng. . Song Shenzong Xi Ning four years, \"Meng Zi\" was first included in the subjects of the Imperial Examination. In the sixth year of Yuanfeng, Mencius was officially sealed for the first time, and was Zou Guogong. In the following year, he was approved to enjoy the Confucius Temple. Later, the book \"Mencius\" was upgraded to Confucian classics. In the Southern Song Dynasty, Zhu Xi also combined \"Meng Zi\" with \"The Analects of Confucius\", \"University\" and \"The Doctrine of the Mean\" into four books, and its actual status is even above the Five Classics. From the Yuan Dynasty to the first year of the Shun Dynasty, Mencius was sealed as the Asian Holy Family. Later, it was called the Yasheng, and its status was second only to Confucius. In the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang compiled \"The Mencius Festival\", and deleted the chapters in \"Meng Zi\". If the people are expensive, the society is second, the gentleman is a light, the thief is a man, and he is a husband. Jun also waits. Zhu Yuanzhang once said that this old is getting better today! Vietnamese scholar Zhang Hanchao said in the article: For the scholar-officials, the non-confucian way is not before Chen, and the non-Confucius and Mencius does not describe it. The pre-Qin Confucianism paid great attention to the issue of human nature. In the history of Chinese human nature, the first person to propose sexual good is Mencius. He believes that human nature is good, just like water flowing down, this is an indisputable fact. Mencius believes that life has the most basic common nature of nature. This is the nature of good or unbearable heart, or the compassion and compassion for others. For example, he said that when people suddenly see children falling into the well, they will have fear and sympathy. This kind of compassion is not to please the parents of this child, nor to gain a good reputation among the folks, nor to dislike the reputation of seeing death, but it is entirely from the natural nature of human beings. It is not a heart.",

Mencius believes that the monarch should take the protection of the people first, and the politicians must protect the people's rights. This is Mencius's people-oriented thinking. Mencius agreed that if the monarch had no way, the people had the right to overthrow the regime. Mencius believes that to obtain political power, there must be a love for the people, and there must be legal means. Moreover, the political power still depends on public opinion. If the virtues of the superiors and the government are not accepted by the people, then the superiors will lose the qualification to continue to govern. Mencius also quoted Shangshu’s pledge: Tianshi’s self-mind, and the audience listened to the people’s attention to the people’s hearts. For this reason, the \"Han Shu\" Yi Wenzhi only put \"Meng Zi\" in the syllabus, as a child book, did not get the status it deserves. In the aftermath of the Five Dynasties and Ten States, the latter monk Meng Meng ordered the eleventh scriptures of the scriptures, including the Mencius, which may be the beginning of the inclusion of Mencius in the scriptures. When he went to Xiaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty, Zhu Xi called \"The Mencius\" together with \"The Analects of Confucius\", \"University\" and \"The Doctrine of the Mean\" into four books, and became one of the thirteen classics. The status of Mencius was pushed to the peak. It is said that Zhu Yuanzhang, the great ancestor, was dissatisfied with Mencius's people-oriented thoughts, and had ordered Liu Sanwu and others to abridge the relevant content in Mencius. For example, in the \"End of the Heart\" article, the deletion of the people is expensive, the society is second, and the king is light. Cross. And \"End of the Heart\", delete me now and then know that killing is also the most important: the father of murder, the person also kills his father; the brother of murder, the person also kills his brother. However, non-suicidal, also an ear. Seven sentences. Also, \"From the 娄 娄 》 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , feud. Six sentences. Mencius advocated that the monarchy should be benevolent and accept the theory of goodness. Mencius believed that people have a heart that cannot bear people. It is a political policy that cannot be tolerated. The monarchs only want to promote their own virtues, so-called young children and young people, old and old. Old, from caring for your family, to caring for the people, is benevolent. The specific measures for the implementation of benevolent policies are to lead the way, to make the people rich, and to make the people happy, that is, to protect the people and the king, the people naturally support the monarch, and the country is naturally rich and strong. Whether Mencius advocates Wang Dao or Dedao academic circles has different opinions. The thought of Wang Dao should be the abbreviation of the thought of the inner and outer kings, and the thought of the inner and outer kings is out of the Taoist \"Zhuangzi·The World\". Judging from Ma Wangdui's book and Guodian Jiansi Meng School's representative work \"Five Elements\", Mencius advocates good deeds and virtues. The \"Five Elements\" talks about: the benevolence, righteousness, ethics and wisdom of the four elements, the good road also; the righteousness, righteousness, wisdom, sanctification, and morality. Goodness, humanity, morality, and heaven. \"Teacher's Question\" summarizes the virtues of the \"Book of Changes\": the so-called morality is fraternity, honesty, fairness, justice, honesty, trustworthiness, civilization, harmony, degeneration, innovation, democracy, the virtue of the rule of law With virtue.",

          "context": "The Pearl Harbor incident, also known as the raid on Pearl Harbor, Japan’s Pearl Bay attack or Hawaiian war, AI warfare, and Z warfare was a raid on the US Navy’s Hawaiian Territory’s Pearl Harbor Naval Base on December 7, 1941. Combat. The plan to attack Pearl Harbor comes from diplomatic conflicts between Japan and the United States. Since Japan launched its war against China in 1937, it has been unable to escape for a long time, and the economy has gone from bad to worse. In order to continue its war against China, Japan’s national policy has gradually moved toward a plan to seize resources from other countries. In 1938, the then Japanese Prime Minister, Weibo, proposed the Great East Asia The idea of the circle seriously threatened the interests of the United States in China and Asia and triggered a strong protest from the United States. In 1941, the US government asked Japan to withdraw its troops from the French Indochina, and to stop all oil exports to Japan along with the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Since oil is an essential element for the Japanese military to continue the war, the United States has finally decided that Japan will finally adopt a policy of advancing the South China policy to capture the rich reserves of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. At the same time, because the commander of the Japanese joint fleet, Yamamoto, believes that the United States is bound to interfere, it must be given to the US Navy. The fatal blow of the Pacific Fleet has enabled Japan to negotiate with the United States under favorable conditions after the South has achieved results and consolidated its power. To this end, Yamamoto plans to attack Pearl Harbor. The Japanese Navy sent six aircraft carriers, a total of more than 300 fighters, divided into two waves of attacks. Due to the surprise attack on the US military, the Japanese army achieved great results: sinking and damaging eight US warships, three cruisers, and three destroyers, destroying 188 fighters, causing 2,402 deaths and 1,282 injuries. However, the victory of the Japanese army is not complete: the island's power station, maintenance equipment, fuel and command headquarters building have not been destroyed, and the real main force of the future naval battle - the aircraft carrier is not in the port. Even so, compared with the loss of the United States, Japan’s losses were minimal: only 29 aircraft and 5 pocket submarines were lost. A total of 65 soldiers were killed or missing, and a Japanese submarine crew was captured. This military attack has had a major impact on the development of the Second World War. Due to Japan’s undeclared action, American public opinion was furious, and the country’s self-isolationism turned to support the war; while Europe’s Germany and Italy also declared war on the United States, and the United States joined the European battlefield. The strong industrial capabilities of the United States gave a large amount of resources to the various anti-axis countries, leading to the demise of the final Axis. In addition, due to the attitude of President Franklin Roosevelt's allies and the desire to join the World War before the war, there was a conspiracy theory that knew that the Japanese army was about to attack Pearl Harbor without warning. It is still controversial. After the Pearl Harbor incident, Roosevelt published the famous \"National Shame Speech\", claiming that December 7 was a day in which the United States lived in shame and later became the country's anniversary.",

Once the foreign affairs personnel in Washington negotiated successfully, they immediately returned, otherwise they went to Hawaii to carry out the attack. . The attack mode was decided by the fleet commander - Yoshida Mizuo. He judged whether the surprise attack was successful on the scene. If it succeeded, it would launch a signal bomb. The torpedo machine first attacked it, then the horizontal bomber, and finally the dive bomber. If the US military is ready, it will launch two signal bombs, which will be attacked by the dive bomber to induce the position of the anti-aircraft gun and then attack by the horizontal bomber. The decision to start the war on the day is indicated by a password from Tokyo. On November 17, the fleet gathered in the single crown bay and sailed to Hawaii on November 26. On November 20th, the Japanese diplomat Nomura Nomura and the Japanese Secretary of State Codell Hull submitted a final plan for negotiations. The response of Hull’s response was to reject the plan. In the Japanese pre-conference meeting, Hideki Tojo said: The situation is now very clear. We can no longer get what we want on the diplomatic path; in other words, the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and the middle countries have strengthened our economic and military Pressure, we have no choice but to fight against the United States and Britain. In addition, regarding the declarative warfare action in the Hague Convention, since it may have a major impact on the whole operation, Emperor Hirohito and the military discussed for a long time and decided to attack immediately after submitting the declaration of war in Washington. At 10:30 in the morning of December 2, the Tokyo Congress officially decided to declare the war. Nanyun received the new mountain and 1208 at 5:30 pm Japan time. The new mountain refers to the war decision, and the 1208 is the Japanese time. Scheduled attack day. Soon, Yamamoto issued a reprimand to the fleet and said: The emperor’s resurgence of the army is in this battle, and the officers and men must do their part and do their best! According to Warfare’s staff, Watanabe Anji, this was what the Chief of Staff Yu Yu wrap when he was in the toilet. According to the original plan, if the fleet was found to be removed immediately after the movement, then it was reported that Tokyo received information lurking in the Pearl Harbor spy. A total of 9 warships, 3 cruisers and 17 destroyers were parked in the port. There are 4 cruisers and 3 destroyers. The aircraft carriers are all not in the base. They also have no news of the torpedo nets and air balloons in the port. There is no emergency broadcast in Hawaii. The pocket submarine as an action forward began to leave the mothership. At 3:42, the US minesweeper Condor found a periscope in front of Honolulu Harbor. The destroyer Ward fired and dropped a deep-water bomb. Although the Huade immediately reported the matter to the Naval Headquarters, it was not taken seriously. At this time, the time is close to dawn. The Japanese army has arrived at the scheduled launching point of the aircraft. It is 230 miles north of Oahu. Both the Jianmo and Ligan have sent a reconnaissance plane to detect the US military’s counterattack, but within one hour. After receiving no return, Nanyun decided not to consider the details of the original plan at this time, let the 6-point fighter take off early, and another 6 aircraft failed due to technical problems.",

Although the southern war is extremely successful, it still cannot defeat the United States with absolute material advantages. In the 25th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor incident, Yuan Tianshi said: In military operations, the attack on Pearl Harbor was the most successful in the world, but it was a great mistake in politics, which led to Japan’s last surrender. One way. Japan plans to suspend negotiations with the United States before the attack. As of December 7, the Japanese diplomat in Washington has been having extensive discussions with the US Foreign Office, including the US response to Japan’s invasion of Southeast Asia in the summer of 1941. Before the attack, the Japanese ambassador received a long telegram from the Japanese Foreign Ministry and was ordered to submit it to Secretary of State Cordell Hull before the attack. However, the ambassador failed to decode and print this long national book in time. The final declaration of war was submitted to the United States after the attack. In fact, this book was decoded by the United States before it was submitted to the United States in Japan. George Marshall sent an urgent warning to Hawaii immediately after reading this book, but the telegram had to be communicated through the Civil Telecommunications Authority due to the confusion of the US internal transmission system. A few hours after the attack, a young Japanese-American postman sent the telegram to the US military command in Hawaii, and the commander-in-chief, Kimmel, threw it into the trash after watching it. The attack on Pearl Harbor was later proved to be much less than the expected destruction of the battleship. The action at Pearl Harbor actually only destroyed the old American artillery of the big ship. The aircraft carrier was not damaged at all, and it was not enough to affect the war for a long time. Yamamoto once said that the first six months or a year can be smoothly attacked. But for the second and third year of the war, I have no confidence; in addition, Yamamoto’s plan is to prevent the US military from going to the eastern Pacific Ocean for rescue, while the US military plan is to abandon its stronghold when it is in war with the Japanese. The battle was decided at the location of the base camp. Therefore, the attack on Pearl Harbor was originally not thought by both Japan and the United States. It can also be said that Yamamoto’s plan is unnecessary. As for the third wave of attacks, Yamamoto also expressed dissatisfaction with Nanyun’s failure to damage infrastructure and oil tanks. It said that Nanyun Lieutenant would like to escape after a thief succeeded, and did not seize the opportunity to continue to expand the results. I disagree and reiterate that I have achieved my intended purpose. After Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the news of the defeat of the US fleet was spread, and the country’s domestic country was full of joy. Tojo Hideki even said: I promised to finally win the final victory. Yamamoto said in a letter to him that the war is finally about to begin. Although it is full of excitement everywhere, it will all disappear... Pearl Harbor’s victory is negligible and it is not suitable for publicity. This will make the Japanese people ignore the seriousness of the matter. The most important thing may be that the Pearl Harbor incident will immediately Countries that were not in a good position mobilized. It united the United States and defeated Japan together. It may also be the reason why the Allies demanded unconditional surrender.",

It was not until 1780s that it was surpassed by Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham. Today Bristol is an important aerospace, high-tech and financial trading center in the UK with an international airport. There are two universities in the city, the University of Bristol and the University of the West of England. Bristol North, East and South are surrounded by other single management districts: Southeast and Somerset's Bath and Northeast Somerset, southwest and Somerset North Sommerset Adjacent, the northeast is adjacent to South Gloucestershire in Gloucestershire. Bristol is about 41 km from Cardiff, the capital of Wales, to the west, while London, the capital of the United Kingdom, is located about 131 km northeast of the city. On November 15, 2012, the mayor of Bristol was elected as the mayor. Bristol built an independent castle in the 11th century and developed into a trading port in the 12th century. Due to the prosperity of foreign trade, Bristol was a shipbuilding center in the 13th century. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Europe launched a wave of development of the New World of the Americas. Bristol, which is in the Atlantic Ocean, is a slave trade center, and a large number of slaves are sold to the Americas. From 1700 to 1807, more than 200 slave ships were docked in Bristol, selling more than half a million African blacks to the Americas as slaves. Since the 19th century, Bristol has been competing against the city of Liverpool, and Bristol's status as an external port has declined. At this time Bristol changed into an industrial center and began to have a railway connection to the capital, London. With the industrial microtype after the Second World War and the post-war destruction, Bristol is no longer a world-class city. But after the post-war reconstruction, Bristol became the British space center.",

It is estimated that approximately 10% of 20-45 year old northern men and 30% of 18-40 year old southern white men die in the war. There has been a continuous dispute between the US states and the central government since the beginning of the Republican Republic, whether it is the central power or the loyalty of citizens. For example, the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 blatantly opposed the Guest Law and the Repression Act. In the Hartford meeting, New England expressed its opposition to President Madison and the war of 1812. In 1828 and 1832, Congress passed a tariff increase on European industrial products to benefit the industries of the northern states. As this tariff policy will have an economic impact on South Carolina and other southern states that rely heavily on a large number of European agricultural exports, the Southern Agricultural State is worried that European countries will retaliate against the United States and increase tariffs on US agricultural products. Rebound. The South Carolina State Assembly convened a state congress and passed the Federal Act Revocation Rights Regulations, announcing that the 1828 and 1832 tariff laws were invalidated in the state. The state legislature also passed relevant laws and regulations to enforce the regulations, including authorizing the organization of troops and the purchase of weapons. In response to the threat from South Carolina, Congress passed the Military Mobilization Act, and in November 1832 President Jackson sent seven small naval vessels and a military warship to Charleston. On December 10, Jackson replied to the party that countered the federal decree. On the eve of the Civil War, the United States was made up of four distinct regions: the Northeast—the growing industry and commerce and the corresponding population density growth; the northwest—the free peasants developed rapidly here, thanks to the Northwest Regulations.

This anti-slavery novel profoundly depicts the cruel nature of slavery and believes that Christian love can defeat the harm caused by slavery of human compatriots. This makes the people of the North know the bitter tears of the slaves and accelerates. The promulgation of the Abolition Order. The novel's views on African Americans and American slavery have had far-reaching implications, and to some extent have intensified regional conflicts that led to the American Civil War. Before the outbreak of the Civil War, the US Constitution provided the basis for a peaceful debate for the future government and could balance the conflicts of interest and contradictions in this new state relationship. In the past few years, the number of free states and slave states has gradually made the Senate compromised. Balanced. In 1845, the last slave state, Texas, was recognized. Five free states were recognized between 1846 and 1859. Kansas, originally a slave state, was previously rejected, and then joined the Free State in 1861. Subsequently, a large-scale democratic industrial revolution and industrialization wave began in the north, and the old bipartisan pattern was lifted. The increasingly fierce and hostile ideology led to the increasingly impossible of the gentleman agreement that was established in the past to avoid the crisis. At the same time, the states of the South and the United States maintain slavery, making the northern states a preferred destination for new immigrants, so that the North American advantage in Congress and presidential elections is growing according to the size of the population. The party struggle in the 1850s changed dramatically in essence and intensity. The Republican Party was founded in 1854. This new party and Lincoln are opposed to free trade in order to protect the emerging industries of the United States and North America. Although a small number of northerners support the measures to abolish slavery in the South, the Republicans have the ability to get support from northerners and westerners who are unwilling to compete with slaves. The Republican Party won many former Whig members and feared that the former US Senate, the Buchanan government and the Supreme Court were disproportionately affected by the South.",

These slavery and cotton plantation agriculture dominated the state of Shennan on February 4, 1861. The Union State, Jefferson Davis, is the president and establishes a government based on the US Constitution. After the Battle of Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Lincoln called on all remaining state forces to recover Fort Sumter, resulting in the departure of the four states of Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Lincoln’s victory in the 1860 US presidential election triggered South Carolina’s departure from the Union. By February 1861, six more states had done the same. On February 7, seven states adopted the interim constitution for the Confederacy and established the capital in Montgomery. The 1861 Peace Conference, held in Washington, DC in February, attempted to resolve the crisis. The remaining southern states remain in the Federation. Partially out of the federal state seized the federal fortress in the area, President Buchanan protested, but did not make a serious military response except to try to replenish the failure of Sant Fort. However, the governors of Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania secretly purchased weapons and trained the military. In less than a month, on March 4, 1861, Lincoln officially became president of the United States. At the inauguration of his president, he advocated the constitution as a more perfect combination, different from the previous Confederation regulations as a binding Contract; and claiming that it is legally invalid to leave the Union. He claims to have no intention of invading the southern state but will use force to maintain ownership of the federal property. His speech ended with a request to resume federal relations. The South has sent representatives to Washington and is willing to pay for federal property and discuss peace treaties with the federal government. Lincoln refused any representation with the Confederate representatives on the grounds that the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and the negotiations were equivalent to recognizing the Confederacy as a sovereign government. Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, is one of three fortresses still under federal control within the Confederacy, and Lincoln insists on holding it. Under the orders of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, the Pierre Boregard troops of the Confederate government bombarded the fortress on April 12, forcing the fortress to surrender. In the north, Lincoln should send troops to the states to retake the fortress and protect the federation. At the small scale shown by the rebellion at the time, Lincoln convened 75,000 volunteers in 90 days. A few months ago, some governors had carefully prepared the militia; the next day began to act. Although the four southern states have repeatedly rejected the confederation proposal, they refused to send troops to fight against their compatriots, announced their departure from the federation, and joined the confederation. In return for Virginia, the Confederacy moved to Richmond. That city is a symbol of the Confederacy; once it falls, the Confederacy will lose its legal status. Richmond is a difficult place to defend on twists and turns. Although Richmond has been deep trenches, the city's supply was completely disrupted by Sherman's occupation of Atlanta and was completely interrupted after Grant surrounded Petersburg and replenished the Richmond Railway.",

His plan was to weaken the Confederate economy by the federal blockade of major ports; then seize the Mississippi River to cut the South. Lincoln accepted the plan but vetoed Scottrade’s opposition to an immediate attack on Richmond. In May 1861, Lincoln imposed a federal blockade on all southern ports, terminating most of the Confederate international shipping. Illegal vessels and cargoes are seized and are often not covered by insurance. In the late 1861, the blockade prevented traffic between most ports and halted the cotton trade against the southern economy. British investors built small and fast smuggling vessels to transport arms and luxury goods from Cuba and the Bahamas to high-priced cotton and tobacco. When seized, the smuggling vessel and cargo were sold and the proceeds were returned to the federal sailors, and the British crew was released. The blockade triggered a shortage of food and other supplies, and the confiscation of food by the Confederacy led to hyperinflation and food riots in the south. In March 1862, the Confederacy Navy Ironclad Virginia launched an attack on the federal navy to open the blockade; the initial unstoppable, but the next day in the Hampton Anchorage Battle and the new federal battleship Monite. The battle is not a winner, which is a strategic victory for the federal to maintain the blockade. When the Confederacy fled the Virginian to avoid being shackled, the Confederacy began to build a replica of the Monite. Due to the lack of technology to build high-performance warships, the Confederacy tried to buy warships from the UK. In January 1865, the victory of the Federation in the second Battle of Fort Worth blocked the last available port in the South and suspended smuggling. Due to the fierce resistance of the Confederate army in Manassas, Virginia, in July 1861, Major General Owen McDowell led a march to the Confederacy and carried out the first Battle of Manassas. Later, he was repulsed back to Washington by the Confederate generals Joseph Johnston and Pierre Borregard. In this battle, the Confederate Army general, Thomas Jackson, was awarded the title of stone wall because he resisted the federal army like a stone wall. Was awakened by this failure, and in case more slave states were separated from the federation, the US Congress passed the Crittenden-Johnson Resolution on July 25 of the same year, claiming that the war was to preserve the federation rather than terminate slavery.",

But if the coalition continues to catch up, it is possible to seize the federal fortress and the city of Denver, Colorado. Therefore, a citizen from Texas said that if there were no gits from Pikes Peak to block our army, the whole country might belong to us! In April, California organized the federal army and drove the coalition forces in Arizona to the Picacho Pass campaign. As for the eastern part of the United States, the war between the two sides has been going on for nearly three years, and the battle in the northwest has also come to an end. The Federation had several times to seize the territory of Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana during the end of the war in 1862. Therefore, the three states have blocked the river. Especially in Texas, he almost occupied and blocked all eastern ports. At the same time, in order to give the Alliance countries a back door to escape, the western regions of Texas and Louisiana have been on the land, providing cotton plants and other crops to the Matamoros municipality in Mexico. Exchange supplies across Europe to buy people's hearts. In order to prevent these actions, the federal state decided to invade Texas, but failed every time. The victory of the Union State is for example: the Battle of Galveston and Sabine Pass in Texas. Both wars have completely defeated the federal army. In particular, the catastrophic failure of the EFF was in the Battle of Red River in western Louisiana, and the famous Battle of Mansfield. These victories ended the EFF’s aggressive plans for these areas until after the collapse of the Union. Since the Alliance Army was trapped in the east and General Lee’s surrender, the civil war has not stopped in the coming months. The final battle between the two sides was in the Battle of Palmito Ranch in southern Texas. Ironically, this is a big victory for the Alliance. In 1863, General Grant had already controlled the entire Mississippi River Basin, dividing the South into two parts, and the strategic pattern changed from then on. The strategic and economic advantages of the Northern Army made General Li finally give up the capital of the Southern Alliance in April 1865. The victory of the Northern Army was already very obvious. General Lee surrendered within a week after the fall of Richmond. On May 26, 1865, the South Army surrendered in full and the war ended.",

The independent system of judicial power and legislative power in democratic polity can better protect the administrative power. Excessive centralization and dictatorship; democracy is based on the rule of law and public opinion. Political science has a variety of assessments and quantitative indicators for assessing whether a government is democratic and whether it is dictatorial. The Democracy Index, which is published by the Economist Intelligence Society from time to time, is one example. The democracy and dictatorship index compiled by political scientist Cheibub et al. classifies the democratic levels of 199 countries from 1946 to 2008. After dividing the countries of the world into two major types of democracy and dictatorship, the subdivision of democracy is divided into: parliamentary democracy. Mixed semi-presidential democracy, presidential democracy, and dictatorship are subdivided into: royal dictatorship, civil dictatorship, and military dictatorship. The process of transforming a political power from a dictatorial system to a democratic system is called democratization. In the third wave of democratization since the 1980s, dictatorships in many countries in Asia, Africa, South America and Eastern Europe have collapsed. It is the largest and most massive wave of democratization in human history. In East Asia, countries that have changed from a dictatorial system to a democratic system include Mongolia, South Korea, and the Republic of China. In recent years, the influence of dictatorships among UN members has grown. As a result, disputes have arisen, such as Russia, the People’s Republic of China, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Vietnam and other dictatorships have won international disputes with the UN Human Rights Commission. . Although democracies may not completely avoid violations of human rights, the structural factors of the polity make dictatorships more vulnerable to human rights violations. The founder of the theory of democratization modernization, Seymour Martin Lipset, compares the statistics of European democracies and Latin American dictatorships in the book \"Political Man\", and concludes that there is a positive correlation between democratization and economic development. The higher the level, the more likely the country is to be democratic.",

Kodiroism is also known as the warlord dictatorship. Such dictators are also known as leaders of national support. The dictators of Latin America that emerged in the 20th century were quite different. The dictators of these new century were not local military forces, but national leaders who often came to power through military coups or were arched out by national army officers, such as Juan of Argentina. · Qianlong, Vargas in Brazil, Somoza in Nicaragua, Duvalier in Haiti, Pinochet in Chile, Martinez in Salvador, Alvarado in Peru, Tiwu in Honduras Theo Carias Andino, Trujillo in Dominican Republic, Batista in Cuba, Jorge Uveco in Guatemala, Jimenez in Venezuela, Paraguay Stroessner, Ugo Bansell of Bolivia, etc. These dictators often form political alliances with specific social classes in an attempt to uphold the interests of wealthy and powerful elites, or to establish comprehensive left-wing social reforms. In the first half of the 20th century, the communist and fascist dictatorships of various technologically advanced countries were very different from the post-colonial dictatorships in Latin America or Africa and Asia.

On August 6, 2014, it approached the comet by a distance of about 100 km and reduced its relative velocity to 1 m/s, making it the first spacecraft intended to meet the comet and enter its orbit. After further maneuvering, the plan is to approach orbit after 30 km and approximately 6 weeks later. It is part of the basic mission of the European Space Agency's Horizon 2000, and it is the first mission designed to orbit the comet and land on the comet. The Rosetta was launched by the Aryan V carrier rocket at 07:17 GMT on March 2, 2004, and arrived on the comet on August 6, 2014. The Rosetta consists of two main components: the Rosetta detector, which has 12 instruments, and the Philae lander, with an additional nine instruments. The Rosetta mission will orbit the 67P/Churyumov-Glahimenk comet for 17 months and is designed to complete the most detailed study of the comet's history. The mission was controlled by the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. The detector is named after the Rosetta Stone, and it is hoped that this mission will help unlock the mystery of the solar system before the formation of the planet. The lander was named after Philae, the name of the small island in the Nile, where an obelisk was discovered and assisted in interpreting the Rosetta Stone. The comparison of the pictograms of the Rosetta Stone and the Obelisk catalyzes the declassification of the Egyptian writing system. Similarly, it is hoped that these ships will lead to a better understanding of comets and the early solar system. On its way to the comet, the spacecraft has completed the two asteroids' flying missions. In 2007, the Rosetta also carried out a Mars gravity boosting orbit. The Rosetta Lander of Rosetta landed on the comet on November 12, 2014, which is the 67P/Churyumov-Glahimenke comet, becoming the first successful controlled landing on the comet. detector. Astrophysicist Elizabeth Pearson said that although the future of the Philae lander is uncertain, the orbiter Rosetta is the main force of the mission, and its work will continue.",

Each clan will be worshipped by the Supreme God to obtain the long-term peace of clan rule. Most of the clan members are nobles, and the person at the top is the ruler of the Yamato government - the emperor. At the earliest, until the beginning of the bird era, Japan’s Yamato government rose from the local vassal regime to the imperial rule. As a child of the Yamato era, the Asuka era was the first era in Japan's history to be ruled by the Japanese emperor. At that time, the country was now Nara Prefecture, known as the Yamato. The Yamato government, centered on the bird area, has gradually spread to Honshu and Kyushu in Japan after several generations of clan development. The name Yamato was also extended to the policies used by the central government at the time to suppress clan and vassal states scattered throughout Japan. Based on China's feudal political system, the Japanese established a central government and a royal government composed of members of the emperor and its clan, but they did not have a fixed capital. In the middle of the 7th century, the vassal states gradually expanded into a state under the central government. The most basic administrative unit of the Wuyiqi system is the country and the road. Most of the population's occupations are farmers, others include fishermen, weavers, potters, mechanics, ordnance and religious ceremonies.

He is very influenced by Confucianism, especially with regard to the idea of destiny. He believes that the rule of the Emperor is the will of God. Under the promotion of Prince Shengde, Japan began to follow the ranks and etiquette of Confucianism. His seventeen constitutions provided moral standards for the disorderly Japanese bureaucrats and aristocratic society.",

Further codification was compiled after the Emperor of the Emperor issued the order of the Emperor of Heaven in 689, according to the palace of Emperor Tianwu. The completion and consolidation of the entire legal system continued until the enactment of the Dabao Order in 701. After that, except for a few amendments, it was used as the main law of Japan until 1868. Although the law was developed in the Chinese model, it was Japan's own creation. However, some scholars still believe that the entire law system is modeled on a certain political system in China. Dabao ordered the criminal regulations based on Confucianism and the centralization of Chinese style through the sacred officials and the eunuchs. Although Japan did not use the Chinese imperial examination system, it followed the example of setting up a university in China to cultivate future officials with Confucianism. The law system has greatly changed the aristocratic hereditary tradition. However, the origin of the aristocracy is still an important condition for being in a high position. In fact, after the promulgation of the big treasure, the title can be re-historic. The law system did not abolish the monarchy. In the 5th and 8th centuries, there were several female emperors in Japan, but after 770 years, all the emperors were male. Nakahara, the son of Zhongchen’s lame, is not the same, and is the core figure in completing Dabaoling. According to the Japanese history book, the Japanese writers, two of the 19 writers of the Dabaoling are Chinese scholars. Chinese scholars also act as linguistic experts, and they have obtained two monopolies of the Emperor. Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty sent Gao Bianren to the Shu State, and Shu Minghuang clashed with him. After that, the Tang Dynasty and the country were alienated.

At the end of the year, the newspapers were sent to the stocks of considerable shares; Wu Dingchang was appointed as the president, Hu Zhengzhi was the manager and deputy editor-in-chief, and Zhang Jiyu was the editor-in-chief and deputy manager; the trio co-organized the committee to study current affairs, discuss opinions, and decided to Take turns to write. Finally, Zhang Jizhen is responsible for the amendment. When the opinions of the three people are different, the majority decision is made. When the opinions of the three people are different, Zhang Jizhen shall prevail. On the first day of September 1926, the re-issue of Ta Kung Pao was published by Zhang Jiyao in the \"The Interest of the Society\", and proposed the famous four non-social training: no party, no private, no sale, no blindness. When the Ta Kung Pao was reissued, the circulation was less than 2,000. In May 1927, it increased to more than 6,000. The advertising revenue increased from more than 200 yuan per month to more than 1,000. The business settlement was changed from a monthly loss of 4,000 to a break-even. It reached 50,000 copies in 5 years and exceeded 100,000 copies in 1936. It has become a national first-class news publication and public opinion center. In 1928, the Northeast was changed, and in the late 1930s, Zhang Xueliang was electrified to support the two major news of Jiang's entry into the country. Both were published exclusively by Ta Kung Pao. In December 1935, Wu Dingchang became the Minister of Industry and resigned as the president. In view of the tension in Pingjin, Ta Kung Pao began to develop southward. On April 1, 1936, Ta Kung Pao settled in Wangping Street, Shanghai, and established the Shanghai version. The Tianjin and Shanghai editions were issued at the same time, and Ta Kung Pao officially became a veritable national newspaper. From 1935 to 1937, the northwest travel newsletter of Fan Changjiang was serially reported to the Communist Party and the Red Army. The Publishing Department of Ta Kung Pao also compiled Fan Changjiang’s Northwest Travel Newsletter, entitled “Northwest Corner of China”, which was published seven times. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, Fan Changjiang was published to report on the communication set of the Northern Shaanxi Base of the Communist Party of China. The most glorious period of Ta Kung Pao was from 1926 to 1949, and the newspaper was the most famous. Wu Dingchang, Zhang Jiyu, Hu Zhengzhi and other reporters made it the leader of the Chinese press at that time.",

The Tianjin version and the Shanghai version were suspended on August 5 and December 14, 1937, respectively. Zhang Jiyu led Cao Gubing and Wang Yusheng to successively founded the Hankou version and the Chongqing version. Hu Zhengzhi led Jin Chengfu and Xu Zhucheng to successively founded the Ta Kung Pao Hong Kong version and the Guilin version. During the Anti-Japanese War, Ta Kung Pao moved and migrated, and property losses were serious. However, due to the management of the law, the newspapers still achieved considerable development. The 渝, Hong Kong and 桂 versions were issued at the same time. Domestic newspapers are hard to find on the scale and influence of public opinion. In October 1940, the Huangqiao incident broke out, followed by the New Fourth Army incident. \"Ta Kung Pao\" slammed the attack of the New Fourth Army on the anti-Japanese army and supported the military's military disposition of the New Fourth Army. In April 1941, Ta Kung Pao received a letter from the Missouri School of Journalism. It is believed that Ta Kung Pao has a long history and represents Chinese newspapers. In the long period of China’s serious situation at home and abroad, Ta Kung Pao’s reports on domestic news and international affairs have always been full and quintessential, and its courageous and sharp social assessment has affected the domestic public opinion. The history of the struggle of Ta Kung Pao since its inception has been a highlight in the history of Chinese journalism. This is the first time a Chinese newspaper has won the title of the best newspaper. On the same day, the Chongqing press brought a grand gathering to celebrate the celebration; Ta Kung Pao published the \"Declaration of the Society's Fellows\", summarizing the successful experience of Ta Kung Pao as the literati's political and commercial management. In September 1941, when Zhang Jiyu died, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the people from all walks of life in the country almost gave him a very high evaluation. After the death of Zhang Jiyu, the internal organization changed: the joint office of the directors and supervisors was established, and the chairman of the board of directors of Hu Zhengzhi unified the leadership of the museums; the social assessment committee was established, and Wang Yusheng was the chairman, responsible for the topic selection, discussion and writing of the social assessment.",

          "context": "Motorcycles, also known as locomotives, Autobikes, and bicycles in Taiwan, are called motorcycles in Hong Kong and Macao, and the Southeast Asian Chinese Circle is called Capricorn. It refers to two or three-wheeled motor vehicles, derived from motorized bicycles. With two rounds as the bulk. Its variety is quite diverse, mainly in the hands of locomotives, light locomotives, speed skating, and American locomotives. Some special-purpose locomotives will be equipped with external auxiliary wheels, such as mentally handicapped vehicles. On some military or police vehicles, a side car and auxiliary wheels will be added to become a special three-wheeled vehicle. The locomotive has the characteristics of simple operation, convenient operation and low price. It is widely used in daily life, transportation, public security and military, and is also widely used in developing countries. There are currently about 200 million locomotives in the world, with a density of about 33 per 1,000 people; most of the locomotives are concentrated in Asia, accounting for about 58% of the world's locomotives. In the history of the vehicle, the bicycle first appeared, followed by the locomotive, and finally the car appeared after the transmission was mature. The world's locomotives are originated in Europe, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and the United States in North America. The first market-oriented locomotive design was the Butler Petrol Cycle, a three-engined vehicle designed by Edward Butler in the UK in 1884. The locomotive is powered by a five-eighth 600cc water-cooled four-stroke engine and produced by the Merryweather Fire Vehicle Manufacturing Company. However, the locomotive did not succeed because Butler did not have enough funds. Another locomotive that uses internal combustion engines is the Daimler Reitwagen locomotive designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and William Maybach in 1885. This locomotive is equivalent to a gasoline four-stroke engine mounted on a wooden two-wheeler, but it is different from the bicycle at the time: centrifugal force is not generated by tilting the vehicle, and the vehicle is turned, completely unused 70 years ago The bicycle principle was developed and replaced by the swing of the two forks. However, this locomotive was not used for practical purposes, but only as a carrier for the development of internal combustion engines by two people. However, before the invention of the two locomotives, there were a number of locomotives, electric locomotives and two-wheeled vehicles using diesel engines. If the three types of vehicles are also counted as locomotives, the first locomotive should be a locomotive made by the Frenchman Nicholas Courin in 1769 using a steam engine.",

          "context": "In 1894, Germany's Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first publicly available locomotive and was first known as the Motorrad German locomotive. The British manufacturer Excelsior Motor Company began manufacturing a self-developed locomotive in 1896. In the early days of the history of locomotive development, many bicycle manufacturers have adapted their own bicycle designs to install internal combustion engines. With the strengthening of engine horsepower and changes in bicycle design, the number of locomotive manufacturers has soared. At the same time, many people who originally developed locomotives in the 19th century, such as Gottlieb Daimler and William Maybach, mostly started to develop cars. In 1903, the famous American locomotive manufacturer Harley Davidson was founded and began to manufacture locomotives. Until the eve of World War I, the world's largest locomotive manufacturer was an Indian company that produced more than 20,000 locomotives a year. During the First World War, due to the great role of locomotives in frontline communications during the war, the demand for locomotives in European countries increased, and locomotive production surged again. The intelligence officers on the battlefield gradually turned from horseback riding to riding a locomotive. 50% of the locomotives produced by Harley locomotives in the United States are war required. The British triumph company sold more than 30,000 H-type locomotives to the Three Kingdoms during the war. The H-type locomotive is equipped with a 499cc single-cylinder air-cooled four-stroke engine, and the rear wheels are driven by a belt. This is also the first revival locomotive that does not use bicycle pedals. The H-type locomotive is usually considered the first modern locomotive. By 1920, the Harley locomotive was the world's largest locomotive manufacturer, and its locomotives were sold to 67 countries. From the late 1920s to the 1930s, Germany's DKW replaced Harley as the largest locomotive manufacturer. In the 1950s, the streamlined design made a foray into the race locomotive industry. The locomotive with large fairings became a feature of locomotive design at the time. NSU and Moto Guzzi became the leaders of streamlined locomotives. NSU's advanced design did the most, but after four NSU racers lost their lives in the 1954–1956 World Motorcycle Championships, NSU stopped designing such locomotives and no longer participated in the World Motorcycle Championships. In 1958, for safety reasons, locomotives using fully enclosed fairings were banned from use by the International Motorcycle Racing Association. From the 1960s to the 1990s, small two-stroke locomotives became popular around the world, one of which was due to the two-stroke engine invented by Walter Kaaden of East Germany in the 1950s.",

          "context": "Japan's locomotive manufacturing industry originated from the Honda A-type moped produced by Honda Tech Industrial in 1940. In 1948, Honda officially began producing locomotives. In the 1950s, the Japanese locomotive manufacturing industry flourished, and more than a hundred manufacturers came together. However, the locomotives manufactured by these manufacturers were basically counterfeit locomotives of European manufacturers. In the 1950s, various manufacturers gradually developed their own styles. Among them, Honda Techno Industry, Yamaha, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Suzuki Motors' four locomotive manufacturers gradually dominated the Japanese locomotive manufacturing industry. The locomotives manufactured by the four companies are exported to Europe, America and Southeast Asia, gradually making Japan the center of the world's locomotive manufacturing industry. At present, the export volume of Japanese locomotives ranks among the top in the world. In the 1960s, various industries in Taiwan gradually emerged, and locomotives became the main means of transportation, and the overall demand was expanded. However, due to the shortage of foreign exchange, it is difficult to import enough locomotives. The government encourages investment in the locomotive industry and sets the self-made rate, which is increasing year by year. In November 1961, Taiwan Sanyang Industrial Co., Ltd. cooperated with Honda of Japan to produce the first locomotive in Taiwan. Since then, Sanyang Industrial has started to produce 50cc and 150cc locomotives, becoming the first locomotive manufacturing company in Taiwan. Since then, Taiwan's locomotive manufacturing industry has risen, with more than 40 manufacturers at its peak. Since 1988, locomotives produced in Taiwan have been exported to mainland China. In 1993, Sanyang Industrial built the first joint venture in Hunan, China. The first locomotives built in mainland China were the Jinggangshan locomotives built by Beijing Sixth Automobile Manufacturing Plant on July 8, 1951. This locomotive is modeled after the German Schindler K500, using a two-cylinder opposed four-stroke air-cooled engine with a cylinder volume of 498ml, engine power of 11.8Kw, maximum speed of 110km/h and self-weight of 195kg. After that, many automobile manufacturers in China have produced a variety of locomotives. Because they are mostly military, locomotives with sidecars account for the majority. After the reform and opening up, a large number of locomotive manufacturers have emerged in China, but most of them are joint ventures. Among them, there are many joint ventures with Japanese manufacturers, and there are very few locomotives developed by themselves, and the quality is uneven. On December 15, 2000, the first Zongshen 750 manufactured by Chongqing Zongshen Group was shipped. This is China's first large-displacement road racing car. At present, China is one of the countries with the largest number of locomotives manufactured worldwide.",

Some new forms of cross talk, such as playing cross talk, comic dialogue, etc., have been developed, but the market is still small. Despite this, the cross talks have achieved a lot of development during this time: a new generation of actors has emerged, and new cross-talks in various content and forms have continued to stage, forming a contemporary cross talk before the different. Among them, whether it is a singer-song entertainment or a slap in the face, there are many examples that are popular among the public. In various literary and artistic occasions of this period, cross talk is still the protagonist of the entertainment public. Beginning in the mid-to-late 1990s, cross talk began to decline gradually, new sections became less and less, the popular works were rare, and the content of satirical politics in the content was increasingly rare, and the old-fashioned pure entertainment style comic dialogue began to gradually increase. At the same time, the comic actor, including many well-known actors, left the stage of the comics and went on to do other work, but there are not many newcomers who can take over. The status of cross talk has gradually been replaced by a prosperous piece. At the beginning of the 21st century, cross talks were in a state of ignorance in the Chinese mainland: the older generation of artists have fallen, and the popular actors in the 1980s have shown a state of inability to the development of cross talks; in the National Crosstalk Competition for the resounding of cross talks The new generation has never been booming. The development of cross talk is not optimistic for most people, but outside the media, many traditionally performed cross-talking troupes still retain a certain level and have a considerable audience. Many small theaters and teahouses in Tianjin can hear quite beautiful traditional cross talks. Guo Degang, who also performed in the traditional way of teahouses, became popular after 2005. Although it is different from the real teahouse comics, it brought some recognition to the audience and let the Chinese mainland see the hope of reviving the cross. Guo Degang not only adapted a lot. The traditional cross talks also created a large number of cross talks, such as the successful \"I\" word series, \"You\" word series; at the same time promoted the crosstalk of the singer Taiping lyrics. Under the efforts of Guo Degang-based comic actor, the cross-talk art in mainland China also held a large-scale performance in non-Chinese speaking regions for the first time.",

          "context": "Since ancient times, Hong Kong has been circulating in the Central Plains. As early as the Qing Dynasty, literati and storytellers from mainland China brought the traditional art of cross talk to South Guangdong and Hong Kong. For historical reasons, Hong Kong was ceded as a British colony. Since then, the development of comic dialogue in Hong Kong has entered a unique period of localization. In the early years of the Republic of China, Hong Kong's cross talks mainly appeared in street art, and most of the special comic artists were mainly jugglers such as storytelling and oral skills. Most of them come from all walks of life, know how to read books, and like to chat, so they use the form of cross talk to make a living. In the 40s and 50s, Hong Kong films began to develop rapidly, and comic art began to integrate into emerging media. In the numerous copies of the old Hong Kong movies in the memory, we can see the form of stand-up comic dialogue and cross-talking, and began to integrate into the early Hong Kong movies, mostly in the form of actors' monologues and mutual ridicule. In 1957, the world's first Chinese-language TV media was born, which is the TV of the predecessor of today's Asian TV. The comic dialogue began to leap into the TV media and became a fixed performance program for variety shows. Then in 1967, Hong Kong's wireless TV was born, and the world's longest-lived variety show \"Happy Tonight\" was launched. The comic art began to appear in a wider variety of TV variety shows, such as the host's speech, the program and the program. The string field and so on. After the division of the two sides, some performance groups from southern China went to the Malaya area for development. The comic actor Feng Xiang, Bai Yan and Lu Ding performed cross talks in the Ma Xin area. Because the unique multi-language environment in the Ma Xin area makes Ma Xinxiang's crosstalk more unique than that of mainland China and Taiwanese cross talk, but because of the problem that Chinese is not a mainstream language, Ma Xinxiang's professional actors are few.",

Therefore, Gustavs believes that he is a modern composer, and Flaubert has said that it is crucial to have a famous modern taste. The Impressionist movement sees the eradication of tradition as one of the most important changes, and now it seems that this is actually a modernist movement. In literature, the symbolist revolution has greatly influenced the development of modernism, mainly because of its emphasis on feelings and feelings. On the philosophical side, Nietzsche and Freud et al. provide an important support for the further destruction of this transformation: from the basic principles, abandon the original definitions and systems. This wave of change basically stayed in the standard norms of the 19th century, and participants often thought of themselves as reformers rather than revolutionaries. Since the 1890s, with the further advancement of reforms, there has been a thought that should be put aside the previous standard norms. Change should be more thorough, not just to edit and modify past knowledge in accordance with contemporary technology. Corresponding to this change in art, there is the development of relativity in physics; the continuous integration of internal combustion engines and industrialization; and the application of social science in public decision-making. In the first fifteen years of the twentieth century, a series of writers, thinkers, and artists abandoned traditional methods of writing literature, painting, and music. Similarly, the same practices are commonplace in other fields. Those who choose this approach believe that if the actual thing itself is suspicious, then the rules and regulations used to restrict people from dealing with these things lose their meaning. So in art, there must be radical changes in nature. The production model of this era is in line with the rationality and maximum utilitarian goal of modernism. Emphasis on production concepts that are standard, predictable, measurable, and efficient. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Henry Ford invented the world's first fitting line, allowing entrepreneurs to realize the opportunity to reduce costs and mass production. Ford's production line logic was immediately used by other industries to uncover the economic boom of the United States in the early 20th century. Although the production line has reached the desire of entrepreneurs, because the production line is produced through a single professional production of each node, and then through transportation and assembly, the workers are bored and bored, and the effect of psychological alienation occurs.",

It is also found in Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas Hakka immigrant areas. The central cultural districts in the more concentrated areas are located in the northeastern part of Guangdong Province, namely, Yuedong, Yuebei, and southern Jiangxi, west of Fujian. That is, the triangle of the Guangdong-Yunnan region. Also known as the border area of Fujian, Guangdong and Guizhou. Hakka is also called Lingdong. In mainland China, there are Hakka-speaking ethnic groups in Guangdong, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, and southern Zhejiang, including 20 million in Guangdong, 9 million in Jiangxi, 2 million in Fujian, 1.5 million in Hunan, and 200 in Sichuan. Ten thousand people, 5 million people in Guangxi. The total number of Hakka users in Taiwan is 2.12 million, mainly concentrated in Taozhu Miao, Taiwan Middle East, Liudui, and East Rift Valley. The influence of Taiwanese Hakka is second only to Taiwanese Minnan. Scholar Luo Xianglin believes that the Hakkas first migrated from North China to South China with the tide of immigration during several wars and turbulent times in history. Their ancestors migrated from the present Henan Province and Shanxi Province, and they also brought the characteristics of the language in which they were located. . The Hakka ancestors were originally the Han people of the Central Plains. Many of the ancient Chinese phonetic features still used in Hakka, including the suffix consonants that can also be found in other southern dialects, have disappeared in some northern Mandarin. Due to the migration of Hakkas, Hakka language will be influenced by dialects in which Hakka ancestors migrated to the region. For example, many shared vocabularies can be found in Hakka, Min Nan, and Cantonese. On the basis of inheriting ancient Chinese, the voice of Hakka language has a regular sound change. Scholar Luo Jinjin believes that the Hakka language has a common origin with proverbs and proverbs. After learning the process of Chinese written language, the characteristics of northern Chinese were introduced, and finally became the object of today.",

His achievements include improving the telescope and the astronomical observations it brings, as well as supporting Copernicus's heliocentric theory. Galileo experimented and proved that the object that feels gravitation is not moving at the same speed, but is moving in acceleration; as long as the object is not subjected to external force, it will maintain its original static state or uniform motion state. He also published the principle of inertia to clarify that objects that do not experience external forces will remain unchanged from their original state of rest or uniform motion. Galileo is known as the father of modern observational astronomy, the father of modern physics, the father of science and the father of modern science. Galileo was born in Italy. It is the eldest son of Vincent Galilee and Julia Amanati. Vincent is a famous lute player, composer and music theory scholar. Galileo himself is a dexterous lute player and inherits his father's skepticism about existing authority, the value of exquisite and cautious, quantitative experiments, the cycle of time or rhythm, or musical appreciation, and mathematics and The expectation and enlightenment of the experimental marriage. Three of Galileo's five brothers lived through infancy, and the smallest was Mike Anglo became the famous Lute player and composer. Galileo is named after a family ancestor Galileo Bonito. Bonito was a Florentine doctor, university professor, and politician; in the late 14th century, the family name was changed from Bonito to Galilee. Galileo Bonito was buried in the Basilica of St. Cross in Florence, and 200 years later the famous descendant Galileo Galilei slept with his ancestors. When Galileo Galilei was 8 years old, his family moved back to Florence, but he was fostered for two years at Jakab Bolognese. Later, he studied in the Camadoles Monastery in Vallombrosa, 35 km southeast of Florence.",

          "context": "Dawa Solobe explained that during this period, Urban was deeper and deeper in the court conspiracy and state affairs. He placed himself in the second place with Galileo's friendship and focused more on his own safety. In the low valley of Urban, the Galileo problem was put up by the court insiders and Galileo's enemies. Urban felt angry and panicked because of the recent statements by the Spanish cardinal that accused Urban of being weak in protecting the church. This is very unfavorable for Galileo's defense. Pope Urbanb VIII privately found Galileo earlier, asking him to give a rebuttal to both the pros and cons in the book, and be careful not to deliberately publicize the heliocentric theory. The Pope also requested that his own opinions be placed in the book, which was later completed by Galileo. However, I don’t know whether it’s inadvertent or deliberate. Simplicio, who defended Aristotle’s geocentric dialogue in the Dialogue between Ptolemy and Copernicus, is often contradictory and ugly in the book. . Although Galileo stated on the title page that Simplicio is an Aristotelian philosopher, its name means big idiot in Italian. This Simplicio role made the book \"Dialogue between Ptolemy and Copernicus' two world systems\" an image that attacked Aristotle's geocentric theory and defended Copernicus' theory. Unfortunately, Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicio. Most historians believe that Galileo is not out of malice, but underestimates the consequences of the work. However, the Pope did not despise this public insult or the propaganda of Copernicus. Galileo was thus alienated from the Pope, his biggest and most important supporter, and summoned to Rome for trial. In September 1632, Galileo was summoned to Rome for trial. He arrived in February 1633 and was accused by the judge, Vincenzo McLean. Throughout the trial, Galileo insisted that he kept his promise, did not preach any ban, and even denied denying the ban at first. However, he finally had to be forced to admit that readers of Dialogue might be misled into thinking that it was defending the Copernican doctrine. Another view is that Galileo even claimed that he gave up the Copernican doctrine after 1616 and even proved this in Dialogue. In the final trial in July 1633, he was threatened to use him if he did not confess. But he insisted on denying.",

          "context": "The judgment of the referee's June 22nd consisted of three core parts: Galileo was convicted of strong heresy, claiming that the sun is at the center of the universe, that the earth is not at the center and moving, and that the refusal and the sacred scriptures The text is awkward. He must swear to give up, curse and reject such views. The heresy court directed him to be formally arrested, and the next day he would be under house arrest at home. His disobedience of \"Dialogue\" will be seized; all his writings will be sealed except for the judgment, and he will not continue to write books in the future. According to popular legends, Galileo once muttered the idea of abandoning the Earth's rotation around the sun, but the Earth is still turning, but there is no evidence to prove that he said something similar. The first record of this legend appeared around a century after his death. After a while, with the help of his friend Ascanio Picolomini, Galileo was allowed to return to his small house in the town of Gyello, near the Arc de la Frontera in Florence, in 1634. There he spent the rest of his life there. Galileo was asked to read seven confession poems every week for three years. His daughter, Maria Celeste, asked the church and was allowed to change the burden to her. When he was placed under house arrest, Galileo devoted himself to completing one of his most classic works, Two New Science, where he summed up everything he has done in the past 40 years. These two new sciences today are called kinematics and material mechanics. This book was praised by Albert Einstein. Because of his contribution, Galileo is known as the father of modern science. He was completely blind in 1638, had severe belching and insomnia, and was allowed to return to Florence for treatment. Galileo first discovered the moon of Jupiter. This discovery is not good news for all celestial bodies that have to turn around the earth. Galileo gave a detailed introduction to the Star Trek in the March 1610 book. According to some unreliable manuscripts, Hans Lieber made the first practical telescope and in 1608 he intended to apply for a patent in the Netherlands. The following year, Galileo made a three-fold telescope. After the improvement, the telescope reached 30 times. Through the Galileo telescope, the observer can clearly see the vertical image on the ground - this is the commonly known ground or small telescope. Galileo also used it for celestial observations, and at the time he was one of the few people who could make such sophisticated observation equipment. On August 25, 1609, he showed the Venetian lawyers eight to nine times the telescope he had made earlier. The sale of the telescope brought a lot of extra income to Galileo. Merchants can use it to sail or exchange goods. In March 1610, Galileo released the results of his initial use of telescopes to observe celestial bodies, entitled \"Star Courier.\"",

Three years later he concentrated his three mathematics papers on Quadratura circuli, Cubatio sphaerae, and Duplicitio cubii. These articles were quickly refuted by Wallis, but Hobbes still did not give up, and published a version that responded to criticism. However, Wallis still refuted the new version at the end of the year. This series of arguments has been maintained until 1678. In addition to publishing a large number of poorly written and highly critical math and geometry books, Hobbes continues to write and publish philosophical works. After the restoration of the British government in 1660, the word \"Hobsism\" was used to refer to the attitude of \"against the love of morality and faith.\" The newly restored young King Charles II was a disciple of Hobbs when he was young.

          "context": "Hobbes stayed in Paris during his time at Leviathan. In 1647, Hobbes was infected with a serious illness, which made him fall to bed for 6 months. After the recovery, he resumed writing and maintained a steady progress until the book was completed in 1650. He also translated many of his previous Latin works into English. In 1650, while waiting for the publication of Leviathan, he allowed publishers to divide many of his early papers into two booklets. In 1651 he published his translation of De Cive. Leviathan’s printing work took a lot of time and finally went public in mid-1651. The title of the book was “Leviathan, or the substance, form and power of the church state and the citizen state.” The cover of the first edition was also illustrated. Very well-known, depicting a giant Leviathan wearing a crown, holding a sword and holding a skull, the body of the giant is composed of countless people. The book just made a sensation when it was published. Soon Hobbes received a lot of praise and criticism, far beyond all other thinkers at the time. However, the publication of this book quickly broke his relationship with other fugitive Baowang factions, forcing him to seek protection from the revolutionary British government. At that time, the Baowang faction tried to kill him, because the realism in the book not only angered the Warring States who believed in the Anglican Church, but also angered the French Catholics. Hobbs fled back to the UK and arrived in London in the winter of 1651. After he turned to the revolutionary government, he was allowed to live a seclusion in Ford Lane in London.",

Subjective feelings produced by the auditory center. The sound waves are generated by the rhythmic changes of the surrounding air pressure. When the objects are vibrating, the surrounding air is also affected. The closer the object is, the more the air particles will be compressed; the farther the object is, the air particles will be pulled apart. Hearing is important to animals, and animals use hearing to escape enemies and capture food. Human language and music are based to some extent on hearing. When the frequency and intensity of the sound wave reach a certain range of values, the animal's hearing can be caused. The vibration frequency that the human ear can feel is about 20-20000 Hz. As you age, the upper limit of hearing decreases, with intensity ranges from 0.0002 to 1000 dyn/cm2. The resistance encountered when the sound propagates through the medium is called the acoustic impedance. When the medium is air, the impedance is small, and when it is solid or liquid, the impedance is large. The acoustic impedance of the ear mainly refers to the total impedance of the middle ear structure during acoustic conduction, which has a decisive influence on the sensitivity and frequency response characteristics of the auditory organs. The lesions of any part of the middle ear structure affect the auditory function on the one hand and the characteristic impedance of the ear on the other hand. In recent years, a new development method that uses the change of acoustic impedance as an indicator to objectively examine human auditory function is called impedance audiometry.",

The auditory organ is known as the ear, and its structure has specially differentiated cells that can sense the mechanical vibration of sound waves and convert the sound energy into nerve impulses called somatosensory devices. Ears of higher animals can be divided into outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The outer ear includes the auricle and the external auditory canal, which mainly plays the role of sound collection; some animals' auricles can rotate freely to facilitate \"capture\" sound. The middle ear includes the tympanic membrane, ossicular chain, tympanic cavity, middle ear muscle, eustachian tube and other structures, which mainly play the role of sound transmission. The tympanic membrane is a thin film structure that encloses the inner end of the external auditory canal. Sound waves enter from the external auditory canal and act on the tympanic membrane, which in turn produces corresponding vibrations. The mammalian ossicular chain is a lever system consisting of three small bones, one end is a hammer stem, attached to the inner surface of the tympanic membrane, and the other end is the sacral floor, which covers the oval window membrane of the inner ear, and the vibration of the tympanic membrane passes through A lever system can be effectively transmitted to the inner ear, the tympanic membrane is the tympanic cavity, and the ossicular chain and the middle ear muscles are all in it. The middle ear muscle, also known as the inner ear muscle, has two pieces: the contraction of the tympanic membrane muscle causes the tympanic membrane to be tensioned by pulling the hammer bone, and the contraction of the tibialis muscle fixes the tibia, and its function is to limit the conduction of sound to the inner ear. The eustachian tube is passed from the tympanic cavity to the pharynx, usually closed, swallowed and opened during certain mouth movements, so that the air pressure in the drum chamber is often balanced with atmospheric pressure.",

          "context": "When the sound frequency is lower than 400 Hz, the frequency of the individual fibers of the auditory nerve corresponds to the frequency of the sound. When the sound frequency is increased, the individual fibers utilize a sound having a higher frequency of the combined volley reaction. Weaver pointed out that the frequency analysis of sounds below 5000 Hz can be performed using the theory of neural volution. The sound frequency exceeds 5000 Hz, and position theory is the only basis for encoding the frequency. The threshold of excitability of sensory cells and neural units is high or low, and there are many sensory cells and nerve cells that are excited when excited. The number of nerve impulses is increased after each nerve unit is excited. For hearing, whether the threshold of the excited unit is high or low, the number of excited units, and the number of nerve impulses can be the basis for sound intensity analysis. According to the emission theory, the increase in the number of excited units and the number of impulses issued only increases the number of fibers that make up each discharge, without increasing the number of emissions, and therefore does not contradict the frequency analysis. It depends on binaural hearing. Due to the difference in distance from the sound source to the two ears and the obstacles in the way of sound propagation, there is a time difference and a difference in intensity when the sound emitted from a certain direction reaches both ears, and its size is related to the orientation of the sound source. The time difference of the sound received by the ears at the same instant is the main basis of the low-frequency sound localization. The intensity difference is the main basis of the high-frequency sound localization, and the sound gathering effect of the auricle also has a certain help for the high-frequency sound localization.",

In terms of architecture, the University of Virginia designed by Jefferson and the \"Paris Pantheon\" built by Suffolk in France are among the most famous buildings. In addition to the University of Virginia, Jefferson has even designed his own home. The American White House, designed by James Holborn and Benjamin Henry Latrobe, also belongs to this style. It was Benjamin Henry Latrobe who introduced this style to the United States. See neoclassical architecture for details. Neoclassical painting began in the early 1760s. At that time, John Joachim Winkelman launched a campaign against the ostentatious Rococo style, which promoted the simplicity of returning to ancient Greece and the Roman era. As a pioneer of this movement, Anton Rafael Mens was the painter who best met the aesthetics that Winkelman preached. His large mural, Banas Mountain, is a work done with Winkelman. The murals are based on ancient Greece and ancient Rome. The construction of the scene uses an orthogonal view. In the choice of color and line, the murals are more prominent in lines and shapes. At the same time, the lack of depth of field gives the picture a bas-relief effect. These elements all reflect the style of Winkelman. Then the movement spread to Rome. The Milanese painter Bossi and Appiani, the Roman painter Camkini, and the Bologna painter Bellaki are four of them. When this wave of neoclassicalism swept through Great Britain and Germany, it slowed its pace in France. It was not until 1770, under the influence of Joseph Mary Wien, that French painters accepted this trend.",

However, in case of addition or subtraction, it may be reduced to less than February or to 20 years. . In Article 35, the term of imprisonment is lighter than the death penalty and life imprisonment, which is heavier than criminal detention and fines.

It is the energy that causes volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. The temperature inside the earth is as high as 7000 degrees Celsius, and at a depth of 80 to 100 kilometers, the temperature drops to 650 degrees Celsius to 1200 degrees Celsius. Through the flow of groundwater and lava flowing to the crust 1 to 5 km from the ground, heat can be transferred to a location closer to the ground. The high temperature lava heats the nearby groundwater, which eventually oozes out of the ground. The easiest and most cost-effective way to apply geothermal energy is to take these heat sources directly and extract their energy. Humans have long used geothermal energy. For example, in the Paleolithic era, there were hot spring bathing, medical treatment, underground hot water heating in ancient Rome, modern crop greenhouses, aquaculture and dried grains. However, the real understanding of geothermal resources and the large-scale development and utilization began in the middle of the 20th century, but modernity uses more geothermal energy to generate electricity.",

In other words, the conversion of geothermal energy into mechanical energy, and then the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy; this way of rotating the turbine with steam is the same as the principle of thermal power generation. However, thermal power generation drives the turbine's working fluid to be maintained by burning heavy oil or coal. It is not only time-consuming but also prone to pollution during the process. Conversely, geothermal power generation is equivalent to placing the boiler and fuel underground, and simply removing the steam can achieve The purpose of power generation. For high-temperature geothermal water as a working fluid, it is usually treated with \"flash steam treatment\", that is, it is rapidly vaporized by a sudden drop in pressure, and is directly introduced into a low-pressure steam turbine to generate electricity to generate electricity. If the working fluid is dry and high temperature superheated steam, it can be directly connected to the turbine. If it contains both water vapor and hot water, it must be separated by a steam-water separation device. After the steam is pushed to the turbine, it will be condensed into hot water. If the hot water temperature is still high, it can be reused by flashing or another way. The condensate at the end of the power generation system is discharged into the river after proper temperature control, or re-injected underground to prevent the formation from subsiding.",

The original concept has been proposed in the 1970s but has not been taken seriously. It is conceived that the geothermal distribution area is extremely limited. Therefore, it has been proposed to use deep drilling technology to drill anywhere near the underground lava to more than 300 degrees, at least 2 wells, one well to inject cold water, one well to recover geothermal heat, after heating Steam power generation, if the cost allows drilling more recovery wells, can reduce the loss of steam; increase power generation efficiency. Although the principle is simple, but because the required depth of the well is more than 5 kilometers deep, and through many hard granite crusts, the traditional drilling method needs to wear hundreds of high-priced drill bits, which is too costly, and the ground conditions are difficult to grasp, and it is possible that the water can not be circulated. The waste wells, coupled with geothermal heat in the mass media, are not as high as solar energy and wind power, and many factors make people reluctant to invest and stop at the experimental stage. However, the concepts of emerging technologies such as hydrothermal rigs and plasma rigs have been proposed, and the cost of drilling is expected to drop sharply. At that time, geothermal energy can provide 24 hours of stable base load without the influence of location and climate. Construction time, cost and public concerns are Far below nuclear energy; it is expected to be the most competitive green energy and global warming solution. Supercritical carbon dioxide fluid can be used as a working fluid instead of water to transfer heat to a geothermal power plant, which then extracts its energy or drives the turbine to generate electricity.",

To transport supplies from the south of the Yangtze River to the capital, it is necessary to use water and land, and it is extremely inconvenient. In order to avoid bypassing Luoyang, the Yuan Dynasty government decided to cut straight and cut new canals, shortening the waterway distance between Jiangnan and Dadu, from Yuandadu to Jiangnan. In the grain area, waterways are accessible in most places. There is no convenient waterway connection between Jeju and Linqing, Tongzhou and Dadu. The Yuan Dynasty built the Jeju River and the Huitong River in Shandong, connecting Jeju and Linqing, and drilling the Bahe River and Tonghui River in Beijing to connect Tongzhou with the capital. As a result, the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which runs from Hangzhou in the south and the capital to the north, has been fully integrated. After the completion of the Jeju River, the Yuan Dynasty government opened a canal to communicate Wenshui and Yuhe River.

In the Qing Dynasty, it became a permanent residence in the Qing Dynasty. The Sui Dynasty in Vietnam also imitated the Qing official system and had the post of Governor.

After 1928, the governors of the provinces were roughly equivalent to the governors of the Qing Dynasty. After 1949, the Communist Party of China set up the first secretary of the Regional Bureau in mainland China. Its status is greater than that of the administrative and provincial governors of the provinces, and all the affairs of the jurisdiction and the local military system. Later, the Grand Administrative Region was revoked, so the current provincial party secretary is similar to the governor/tourist in the Qing Dynasty. The governor is responsible for administrative affairs, and is the same as the Qing dynasty. The provincial judicial department is responsible for the higher courts, and its dean is roughly equivalent to the Qing Dynasty. When modern China first came into contact with the Western colonial system, the term \"Governor\" was used to refer to the chief executives of European and American countries stationed in the colonies, sometimes with similar meanings to the Chinese admiral. Historically Spain's colonies in the provinces, the Naples region and the Americas, as well as the rulers of the British colonies in India, called viceroy, and Chinese was translated as \"the Governor.\" Viceroy is a combination of the Latin word \"vice\", literally translated as \"deputy king\". In terms of terms of reference, this type of governor is more similar to the governor of the Qing Dynasty in China. The term Governor can be used as a governor or governor of a colony or a state or province of a certain country, such as the Governor of Hong Kong and the elected \"Governor\" of the United States, but generally only the head of the colony will be translated into the Governor. Part of the colony, and the British Union, where the British monarch is the head of state, the local representative of the British monarch is also known as the \"Governor\", such as the Governor of Canada, the Governor of Australia, the Governor of New South Wales, and the Governor of British Columbia. Japan in the Chinese character culture circle defeated the Qing Dynasty in the Sino-Japanese War. After the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, it had the post of Governor of Taiwan. In 1910, after the merger of Japan and South Korea, the position of Governor of North Korea was established.",

It refers to the part of the American Catholic Church pastoral area that was converted to Catholicism in the 1980s. It was attributed to the Catholic Church in a special parish mode, and the Catholic rituals derived from the tradition of the Anglican Church were used under this. These parishes use the \"Holy Worship Book\" adapted from the Anglican \"Phrath Prayer Book\" as a ceremonial book. The Anglican case is divided into a variant of the Latin ritual, rather than a church group that forms an independent ritual like the Dongyi Catholic Church. The main purpose of the establishment of the law was that the Catholic Church of the United States, in order to provide the priests and their followers of the former American sacred sect, can still maintain the ceremonial tradition of the use of the sacred sect after the conversion of the Catholic Church, with the consent of the Holy See. The operation of Xi Li is a priest based on the \"Hobbies of the Holy Book\" held by the priests of the Angligan parish in the subdivision of the sect. In addition, Pope John Paul II allowed married male former Anglican priests to be appointed Catholic priests after the conversion. Since Pope Benedict XVI published the Constitutional Decree of the Combination of the Holy Communion, believers and clergy who have been converted from the Holy Communion have been able to choose to participate in the special bishopric jurisdiction, a Catholic specializing in the preservation of the Anglican tradition and other Sanctuary traditions. group. At present, there are three special bishopric districts, namely the Special Bishop of the Virgin of Walsingham in the United Kingdom, the Special Bishop's Jurisdiction of St. Peter's Throne in the United States, and the Special Episcopal Diocese of the Southern Cross of Australia. Although the Anrigan and the special bishopric districts are systems formed by members who have been converted from the Anglican Church, they are different in some places. For example, the Anglican parish area is also limited to the special system of the United States, while the special bishopric area is a traditional organization of the Psalms that can be established after consultation with the Catholic bishops.",

He argues that any seemingly neutral position is actually a potential moral value inference on the issue, judging what is a good life. He quoted Margaret Marshall, a Massachusetts judge who supports same-sex marriage: Marriage is \"the most cherished and worthwhile behavior in our community.\" The key to marriage is not birth. The basic key to marriage is to \"make each other's permanent promises.\" It is argued that the judges of Massachusetts are not only relying on the right to take the path, but also in the judgment that the same-sex marriage conforms to this principle of value, and obtained the ethical inference that the state should open same-sex marriage. On June 26, 2015, the US Supreme Court in the case of Aubergefel v. Hodges, based on the Constitution guarantees everyone's discretion and equal rights, and determines that both same-sex and heterosexual partners should have equal rights to marry. Advocating the same-sex marriage can protect the interests of the family and children, denying that same-sex marriage will strengthen the stigma of same-sex couples. The US Supreme Court has repeatedly invoked the case of a loved couple who ruled against the unconstitutionality of black and white marriages against the Virginia State as a precedent for the application of equal protection clauses and due process provisions in this case.",

Those who support same-sex marriages believe that marriage does not have a fixed and perfect style. With the different environmental and social systems, the form of marriage also adapts to development. In history, there used to be a form of marriage with polygamy, polyandry, or dual marriage. In the matriarchal society, there are also ways of emphasizing the matriarchal family, such as getting married, visiting a wife, and so on. The ideal marriage system should be toward a reciprocal negotiation within equality and intimacy, treating the child as a life choice rather than an obligation to oppress others. The family does not necessarily have the role of husband or father, wife or mother. For example, the traditional family of Mosuo people is the mother and the uncle as parents, and the father and children do not belong to the same family. In the patriarchal society, there are also many single-parent families formed by the divorce of their parents, the death of one of their parents or the unmarried pregnancy. In some cases, parents are absent, so they form a family with grandparents, brothers and sisters or other relatives.",

There is no statistically significant difference between the son’s sexual orientation and the environmental variables that may be relevant. Many professional societies, such as the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Society of Sociology, the Taiwan Psychiatric Association, and the Taiwan Children and Adolescent Psychiatric Association, have issued similar statements stating the growth of children and adolescents' physical and mental health. Family and community stability are closely related, and have nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the caregiver. In addition, comrades and their partners can still achieve the purpose of adoption and the common parenting through the single adoption system. In addition, some people want to adopt a partner and a child in the previous relationship. Limiting the parental rights of these families to their parents and children is a violation of children’s rights and parental protection and parenting rights. Use cross-country data to examine countries with same-sex marriage legalization. The results show that not only did the fertility rate decline in these countries, but there is also no statistically significant correlation with the infection rate of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Through same-sex marriage, it has a positive impact on promoting gender equality in the country, which helps to raise gender awareness in society and reduce the gender class resulting from the distribution of power. Supporters argue that the state recognizes same-sex marriage as a powerful oath to eliminate all kinds of discrimination and untrue statements by opponents, and declares the government's determination to treat gay groups equally.",

Single people are vulnerable to financial constraints and the predicament of not being protected by social welfare. Both human sexual orientation and gender identity require this basic identity contract guarantee, and society can benefit from such stability. It is also estimated that huge social pressure has led to about 16 million gay men and women in China, and about 4 million gay women who marry men. However, on the other side of this type of marriage, it may be necessary to endure the sexual indifference and mental torture of the husband or wife, and it is difficult for them to obtain long-term happiness. If the system cannot contain everyone, many people will conform to the social norms and simply adjust themselves to meet the needs of the system. The denial of same-sex marriage by society makes it easier for more wives or husbands to happen. The most direct industry affected by same-sex marriage is the wedding industry. According to statistics, within three years of the same-sex marriage, the United States will bring about 187 million U.S. dollars in tax revenue to the federal government and the states, and the contribution to the U.S. economy will reach \"2.62 billion U.S. dollars.\" However, the direct economic impact of same-sex marriage seems to be limited relative to the total US GDP of US$ 17.4 trillion in 2014.",

After research, he found that if the image is divided into a single image point, it is highly likely that the image of the person or scene will be transmitted to a distant place. Soon, an instrument called the \"television telescope\" came out. This is an opto-mechanical scanning disc that looks stupid but original. On November 6, 1884, Nipkov filed his invention to the Royal Berlin Patent Office. On the first page of his patent application, he wrote: \"The instrument described here enables an object in position A to be seen in any one of the B places.\" A year later, the patent was approved. The Nipkov disc in this patent is believed to be the world's first television image raster. However, Nipkov himself never made a model to prove his design. It was not until 1907 that advances in amplifier technology proved the viability of his system. In 1897, the German physicist Carl Braun invented a cathode ray tube with a fluorescent fire curtain. When the electron beam hits, a bright light is emitted from the screen. At that time, Braun's assistant had proposed using a cathode ray tube to make a television display.

In this experiment, an image of 240 scan lines was sent to a TV set 4 miles away, successfully making the TV camera and imaging method electronic. The first semi-mechanical analog television system was \"scanned\" by the Scotsman John Logie Baird in an experiment in London on October 2, 1925 as a sign of the birth of television.

After continuously improving the equipment and improving the technology, the TV effect developed by Baird is getting better and better, causing a great sensation. Later, the Baird Television Development Company was established. With the continuous improvement of technology and equipment, the transmission distance of Baird TV has been greatly improved. In 1933, Russian-American scientist Vladimir Zoellin developed a camera tube and a picture tube for television photography. The process of fully electronicizing television and imaging has been completed, and modern television systems have basically taken shape. The imaging principles and instruments that TV cameras and televisions receive today are based on improvements in his invention. On August 25, 1934, Farnsworth presented the world with a complete all-electronic television system for the first time at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Other inventors have only previously demonstrated some of the features of a similar system, or an electronic system that uses still images or dynamic picture films. But Farnsworth was the first to integrate an electronically scanned television camera with an electronically scanned television receiver to provide live, dynamic, and black-and-white images. Unfortunately, his camera needs a lot of light, so his work is forced to break.",

After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, due to the enormous cost of operation of the spacecraft, and the payment of the land rent and use of the Kazakh Baikonur Space Center, Russia has raised funds for private money sponsorship, and the reward is for the sponsors to fly in space. The ship entered space, so most space tourists are billionaires who pay a lot of money. Because NASA's space mission is only for international specialized research, today's space tourism is still dominated by Russia. The passengers at the International Space Station are mainly astronauts performing missions, but since 2001, there have been self-funded space travelers, and there are currently seven space tourists. The idea of self-funded space travel originated from the exchange conditions sponsored by the engineer Dennis Tito for the Russian \"Peace\" space station, and was later developed by the Russian aviation department as a \"space tourism\" commercial project. Every visitor must undergo a rigorous medical examination and training in order to be lucky enough to become a space tourist. The space journey takes about ten days, and the \"ticket\" price is calculated in Russian rubles [source request], which is about 20 million US dollars. The first space visitor was Denis Tito, a businessman from California. On April 28, 2001, he took the Russian \"Union TM-32\" manned spaceship to the International Space Station at the age of 60. Tito was a Jet Propulsion Laboratory Engineer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States and was involved in the design of the orbit of the Mars and Mercury exploration spacecraft.",

When the Soviet elite cavalry troops attacked Warsaw, they were completely crushed by the Polish gunmen. This is also an extremely rare defeat in the history of the Soviet Red Army. The Soviet Union and Russia sought peace, and the two sides signed the \"Riga Treaty.\" The failure of the Soviet Union in the Warsaw campaign also laid the groundwork for the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany to attack Poland in the early days of World War II.

On the side of their own.\" If a person experiences two kinds of happiness at the same time, he will be more inclined to one of them. According to this, Mill divides happiness into two levels. Bian Bian believes that the amount of happiness is equal. The pushpin is not worse than the poetry. If the jumping game played by the children is more happy than the night of the opera, then the society should definitely use more resources to promote the jumping grid. The game is not the operation of the opera house. Mill’s claim is that people who support simple happiness have never experienced high-level art, which is not conducive to their correct judgment. For example, those noble or philosophical practitioners are more beneficial to society than those who aim at their own happiness. The crux of the problem is not the maximum happiness of the actor, but the maximum value of all happiness. Mill believes that educated people have the ability to influence the government to a greater extent. Therefore, Mill supports legislation to give university graduates more voting rights, because they are more suitable to judge what is most beneficial to society.",

This is the boundary between the rights of individuals and society defined by Mill.

On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, Soochow University has three colleges of literature, science and law. The two faculties were the leading Christian universities in China at the time. In the autumn of 1949, the mainland was changed to the flagship. Soochow University was incorporated into the Sunan Normal University. The original site of Suzhou is now the 211 engineering university Suzhou University. After losing the support of the consortium background, Soochow revived in Taiwan in 1954 with the alumni donation and tuition support finance, in the name of \"Soochow University Law School\", and re-named in 1969. Since 1999, Soochow University has launched the Soochow International Super Marathon 24-hour race. In addition to the large earthquake in 2000 and the suspension of the campus construction in 2006, it has been held for 14 consecutive years, attracting talents from all over the world. In the 2012 Soochow Super Horse event, six players have reached the threshold of international competitions, and the Soochow Super Marseille has been promoted to the world's second and only \"gold medal event\" in Taiwan.

People who use these two languages can basically communicate with each other, although many vocabularies are not necessarily identical. However, it is worth noting that many Malay dialects cannot communicate with each other completely. For example, for many Malays, it is difficult for them to understand the pronunciation of Kelantan. In addition, the Malay language in Java, Indonesia, has many unique words. Even Malays who are familiar with Malay cannot fully understand the meaning of these words. In addition, according to the pronunciation of Minnan, Malay and Malay are also translated as \"Wu Laiyou\". Before the Malays converted to Islam, they used a variety of words, the first of which was the Javanese alphabet. Among them, the homemade letter is a letter called Rencong. Before the 20th century, since most Malays believed in Islam, they used an improved Arabic alphabet writing system called \"Knife\" to write. Later, another Roman alphabet writing system called \"Rumi\" gradually replaced the original position of \"Knife\" in daily life. The difference in writing systems between Malaysia and Indonesia actually reflects the difference in writing systems between the different colonial governments that ruled the two places at the time - the British colonial government and the Dutch East India Company.",

Although he had passed the pilot's age limit, he still completed the 13-hour B-52 bomber's mission to North Vietnam as an observer. Stewart refused to make the mission public, because he did not want to be regarded as a celebrity while he was doing his duty as a reserve soldier.

Traditionally, a sphygmomanometer measurement has to be taken every other month and repeated three times before a diagnosis can be made. The initial assessment of patients with hypertension includes a complete history and physical examination. With the advent of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and home blood pressure monitors, the diagnostic procedure has changed in order to avoid misdiagnosis of patients with cerebral palsy. The current exemplary practice in the UK is to have a dynamic measurement follow-up immediately after a clinically high blood pressure high. It is also possible to follow up with a seven-day home blood pressure monitoring method, but the effect is not ideal. Once diagnosed with high blood pressure, the doctor will try to find the root cause of the disease based on risk factors and other existing symptoms. Secondary hypertension is more common in prepubertal children, and most cases are caused by kidney disease. Essential hypertension is more common in adolescents and has multiple risk factors, including obesity and a family history of hypertension. Laboratory tests can also be used to identify possible causes of secondary hypertension and to determine whether hypertension has caused damage to the heart, eyes and kidneys. Other tests for diabetes and high cholesterol can also be done as these are risk factors for heart disease and may require treatment.",

Business has begun to shift from closed-type intra-city transactions to open inter-city transactions. The wholesale trade industry has Great development. This type of city mainly has industrial centers and tourist cities, and some urban economic functions with superior geographical advantages and obvious industrial advantages tend to be integrated. The functions of finance, trade, service, culture and entertainment are developed, and the concentration of cities is increasing. The city's economic energy level has been greatly improved, becoming a regional, national and even international economic center and trade center. Business is developed from pure commodity trading to integrated services, and business activities are extended to all activities that promote the circulation of goods and meet the needs of trading. Such cities are typically municipalities and capital cities in China. The economic function of the city is no longer embodied in an isolated city, but is represented by a cluster of small and medium-sized cities that are centered on a central city and maintain close economic ties with them. For example, the \"Boston-Washington City Belt\" on the east coast of the United States, the \"San Francisco-San Diego City Belt\" on the West Coast of the United States, and the \"Chicago-Pittsburgh City Belt\" in the Midwest of the United States, the Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya City Circles in Japan, Taiwan Taipei-Kaohsiung City Belt, UK's London-Liverpool City Belt.

The Mongolians called Duo Yanwei as Yan Liangha, Taining Wei as Weng Niute, and Fu Yuwei as Wuqi Yete. This is because Duoyan, Taining and Fuyu Sanwei are composed of Yanliangha, Wengniute and Wuqiye. Later, the Ming Dynasty often referred to the three Guardians as Duoyan Sanwei or Yanliangha Sanwei, and the Duoyan, Taining and Fuyu Sanwei stations were collectively referred to as the “Yanliangha Area”. After Yuan Huizong’s acquaintance, Timur Khan, was rushed back to the Mongolian plateau by Zhu Yuanzhang, the Mongolian tribes in this area defended their territory and prevented the Ming army’s attack and carried out active defense. At that time, the descendants of Muhuali Naha came out to command the 200,000 Mongolian Army. They were stationed in the Jinshan Mountain to the north of the Liaohe River to Long'an, Yituhe and Yihehe, and became the defense barriers of the above-mentioned Mongolian ministries.",

Due to the lack of fresh water resources on the island and the absence of long-term freshwater bodies, there is no need for amphibians to inhabit the Diaoyutai Islands. There are 6 species of land reptiles that inhabit the Diaoyutai. There are three types of lizards: the lead mountain gecko, the striated stone dragon and the Taiwanese lizard, and the three species of snakes, the crocodile snake, the king snake and the red chain snake. In addition, the species of the sea snake subfamily inhabiting the East China Sea have also been observed in the waters near the Diaoyutai. However, there are no endemic species of reptiles on the Diaoyutai Islands. In 1978, the Japanese right-wing group, the Japanese Youth Society, also boarded the Diaoyutai, and also brought it to the island as an emergency food and raised by the islanders of the island. Later, the goats began to breed rapidly on the Diaoyutai. In 1991, according to statistics, more than 300 goats inhabited the southern part of the Diaoyutai. However, the large-scale reproduction of goats after wildlife has also caused damage to the island vegetation. In 2000, it was estimated that 13.59% of the land was bare landed from satellite imagery, and in 2006 it grew to 30%.

Stability also prohibits anyone from boarding the island. At present, Diaoyutai does not have regular vessels, so visitors must prepare their own vessels for transportation.

On May 20, the coalition forces covered nearly 1,000 people of the Marine Corps with six gunships and landed on the side of the fort. The Qing army fired back and killed and killed nearly 100 soldiers. The governor of Zhili, Tan Tingyu, abandoned the escape. The squadron was isolated and helpless. More than 300 people in the Qing army died in battle. The North and South turrets were successively captured by the coalition forces. On May 26, the coalition forces arrived in Tianjin City along the river. Under the coercion of the British, French, American, and Russian ambassadors, the Qing dynasty sent the university scholar Gui Liang and the prince Shang Shuhua Shana as the imperial minister on May 28, and rushed to Tianjin to negotiate. During the negotiations, the US and Russian ambassadors played the role of \"mediators\". Before the British and French, they spurred the Qing court to sign the \"Treaty between China and Russia\" and the \"Treaty between China and the United States\" on June 13 and 18 respectively. . Half a month before the signing of the \"Tianjin Treaty\" between China and Russia, General Heilongjiang Lushan signed the \"Sino-Russian Treaty\" with the Governor of Eastern Siberia, Muraveov, under the threat of the Russian armed forces. On June 26 and 27, the Qing Dynasty and the United Kingdom and France signed the \"Treaty between China and Britain\" and the \"Treaty between China and France\". The main contents of the treaty are: the Minister is stationed in Beijing; the opening of Niuzhuang, Dengzhou, Taiwan, Danshui, Chaozhou, Qiongzhou, Hankou, Jiujiang, Nanjing and Zhenjiang is the trading port; the consular jurisdiction is expanded; the compensation for the British is 4 million. Reimbursement of the law two million two; modify the tax rules and so on. The treaty provides for a change of contract in Beijing in the second year. After the signing of the treaty, the coalition forces withdrew southward in July 1858. After the first Battle of Dagukou, Geng Geling was ordered to strengthen defense and repair the post-war Fort.",

Washed away, or severely damaged, the remaining three districts are inland, so the impact of the tsunami is not much. According to the US Geological Survey, the epicenter of the earthquake was located 373 kilometers off the coast of Tokyo, Japan. According to CNN, residents of the earthquake zone continued to feel aftershocks within a few hours after the earthquake. At least 30 aftershocks occurred, of which the largest aftershock was 7.1. Sendai City is a subtropical humid climate under the Keben Climate Classification. It is less hot in summer than in Tokyo, and less cold in winter than in Sapporo. Sendai City is cool and dry in winter, with an average temperature of 1.5 °C in January. It is very warm and has a lot of rainfall in August. The average temperature in August is 24.1 °C. There are very few opportunities for the area to be threatened by typhoons. The rainy season in Sendai City usually begins in late June to early July and is later than in other cities in Japan.

It is currently facing a risk of bankruptcy due to poor performance and financial fraud. In 2015, corporate outbreaks involved up to $1.6 billion in accounting fraud cases, mainly from false revenues from the chip and semiconductor divisions, and the company decided to replace half of its management. Toshiba was formed by the merger of two Japanese companies in 1939. The first company was Tanaka’s industrial manufacturing office founded in Tokyo in 1875. In 1882, Tanaka’s long-time successor Tanaka Taeji named it Tanaka Manufacturing Co., Ltd., and in 1904 established Shibaura Manufacturing Co., Ltd. on this basis. In the early 20th century, Shibaura produced a large-scale mechanical and electrical manufacturing industry in Japan, and gradually grew into a well-known industrial factory. The second company, formerly known as Bai Hotshe, was founded in Tokyo in 1890 by Fujioka City and Sanji Masaichi. It was the first company in Japan to make white hot-light bulbs. After that, Bai Hotshe began to produce a variety of consumer electronics products. In 1899, Bai Hotshe was renamed Tokyo Electric. In 1939, Tokyo Electric and Shibaura Manufacturing Co., Ltd. officially merged into Toshiba today. The new names are the beginning words of the two companies. The English name is also combined according to the Japanese pinyin; To represents the pronunciation of Japanese East, and Shiba represents the pronunciation of Shiba. However, the company did not officially start using the new Toshiba brand name until 1984.",

The structure is generally divided into prose and verse. The verse is mainly composed of seven words, three words, five words and six words.

In 845, he ordered a large-scale attack on foreign religions, including Nestorianism, martyrdom, and Buddhism. Except for a few monasteries in the capital, all the temples were demolished, monks and nuns were forced to return to the customs, slaves in the monasteries were released, and all the fields in the monasteries were confiscated as state-owned.

Moreover, from the excavation of cultural relics such as daggers, buckles, Silla Crown, etc., the art of the Siberian prairie, especially the art of Siberia and Scythian, has a very significant influence on the early Korean Buddhist art. These local art styles are based on geometric and abstract graphics. Although the influence of Chinese culture is very ambitious, Korean Buddhist art “appears calm, tastes moderate, and somewhat abstract but coincides with the color of contemporary art.” Buddhism was officially introduced to South Korea in 372 AD, when it was Goguryeo in the Three Kingdoms period. However, according to Chinese records and Buddhist murals, Buddhism dates back to this official day. In 384 AD, Baekje officially confirmed the introduction of Buddhism into Korea. Due to the lack of good water and land, Silla was delayed until 535 AD to confirm that Buddhism had been introduced. Buddhism has prompted the local artisans who are responsible for the paintings used for the portraits, the architects who built the temples and the scholars who read and write Buddhist scriptures, thus changing the culture of Korea. It is especially important to teach a mature artistic style of the Northern Wei Dynasty. The Northern Wei art style has a profound influence on the art of Goguryeo and Baekje. During the Southern Dynasties, Baekje's craftsmen joined the unique elements of Korea and passed it on to Japan.

Each stupa is decorated with many holes, and the statue of the Buddha sits on the inside. In general, new Buddhist portraits and sculptures throughout Asia are very traditional.

Western art has evolved from the Greek-style Buddhist art of the country. It combines Indian, Greek and Roman styles. The influence of Greek-style Buddhist art on the Silk Road is still found today in Japanese architecture, Buddhist portraits, and the expression methods of some Japanese gods.

The Muslim Party has won the concessions of the other side in the territories and land reforms, maintaining the status of Bosnia and maintaining the interests of the Muslim landowners in the area. The Croatian Republican Peasant Party believes that if loyalty to the king, Yugoslavia will become a monarchy, and therefore refused to take the oath and therefore failed to obtain a seat. The other oppositions initially obtained seats, and later they also boycotted the government. However, the constitutional adoption still requires half plus one vote. Finally, the Muslim organization from Macedonia and Kosovo, Cemet, voted for the vote, which allowed the constitution to pass. On June 28, 1921, the Constitution of Vidovdan was passed, the establishment of a unitary and monarchical state, the abolition of traditional regional planning before the First World War, and the establishment of 33 provinces under the jurisdiction of the central government. Serbian politicians believe that Serbia should be the unity of the Yugoslav states, just like the Piedmont of Italy and the Prussian unity of Germany. In the years after the establishment of the Kingdom, Croatia was increasingly resisting the policies of the Serbian Center. The Croatian Peasant Party leader, Stiepan Radic, was imprisoned for political reasons and was released in 1925 and returned to Parliament.",

The purpose of the League of Nations is as stated in the Covenant of the League of Nations, including the prevention of war through collective security and arms control, and the quelling of international disputes through negotiations and arbitration. The League of Nations and other contemporaneous treaties also refer to working conditions, fair treatment of indigenous peoples, human smuggling and drug trafficking, arms trade, public health, treatment of prisoners of war, and minority groups protecting Europe. During the period from September 28, 1934 to February 23, 1935, the League of Nations reached its peak, with a membership of 58. The diplomatic thinking embodied in the League of Nations reflects the fundamental transformation of the world’s diplomatic style over the centuries. The League of Nations does not have its own armed forces and therefore needs to rely on the international powers of the time to implement its resolutions, maintain economic sanctions, or provide troops when necessary. However, these major powers may not be willing to do so. Economic sanctions can also hurt members of the League of Nations, so these countries are unwilling to cooperate. Because the United States refused to accept the Treaty of Versailles because of the Senate, it did not join the League of Nations at the beginning.",

The city covers an area of nearly 20,000 square kilometers, ranking first in Liaoning Province, accounting for one-seventh of the province's total area. The long history of Chaoyang can be traced back to the Paleolithic era more than 100,000 years ago. Pigeon Cave in Kazuo County is the earliest ancient human settlement in Northeast China. Four or five thousand years ago, in the Chaoyang area, there was an original \"new person\" who was similar to the modern system. The discovery of the large altar, temple and ruins of the Chaoyang Hongshan culture proves that the Chinese ancestors entered the ancient civilized society more than 5,000 years ago, making the Chaoyang area one of the birthplaces of Chinese civilization.",

Compared with the ordinary citizens who used the \"silver currency\" which was devalued at the time as the main income, the military's salary was quite stable. The Roman legion needs to undertake a large number of heavy civil engineering such as paving roads, cutting wood and digging. In order to alleviate the intensity of such labor, most soldiers will often bribe the centurion. In daily labor, they are often whipped by centurions. The dissatisfaction of ordinary soldiers with the centurion and even the head of the army will come from this.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the earliest academic leaders were Nan Guonong and Xiao Shuzi, two returning masters from Columbia University. Xiao Shuzi and the national electrification education training course founded by Nanguo Nong trained a large number of audio-visual backbones. In the 1990s, the second generation of academic leaders He Kekang and Li Kedong promoted the transition from the original electrification education to educational technology. He Ke's main contributions include the introduction of the American AECT'1994 definition, the introduction of constructivist instructional design concepts, and the advocacy of the dominant subject's instructional design. Li Kedong's main contribution is to promote exchanges between Chinese academics and foreign academic circles, and has organized a number of global international academic conferences at South China Normal University. Today's educational technology has more than 200 undergraduate majors in China, which is related to the low level of informationization in China's education; more than 80 master's programs; more than 10 doctoral programs. In general, high-level talents in educational technology are still scarce. The problem currently being studied is the lack of a recognized set of research methods. Since Chinese educational technology scholars are mostly from science and engineering, they are mostly based on online course development and lack of psychological research on learners.",

It was originally made of barbed wire and masonry, and was later consolidated into a border defense facility consisting of a watchtower, a concrete wall, an open area and an anti-vehicle trench. The East German government called the wall an \"anti-fascist defense wall\" whose purpose was to prevent East German residents from fleeing to West Berlin. The Berlin Wall is also known as the \"window of the free world\" because it blocks the West Berlin area from being surrounded by the islands. It was an important landmark of the German split and the Cold War after the Second World War, and it also became a symbol of the Iron Curtain that divided East and West Europe. The establishment of the Berlin Wall was caused by the conflict between the two camps of the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

In 1949, East Germany and West Germany were respectively established as two sovereign and independent countries. Since West Germany did not notify East Germany, the abolition of the old mark and the implementation of the B mark mark had a serious impact on the East German economy, which triggered retaliation from the Soviet Union and East Germany. The Soviet Union forced West Germany to abandon West Berlin and forced West Berlin. Water cuts and grain breaks, this move allowed the Western countries to unite. Every day, many planes transported materials from West Germany to West Berlin. In April 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established, and the Soviet Union lifted the blockade in May 1949.",

On August 1st of the same year, the telephone records of the first secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Khrushchev and Ubrich, showed that Khrushchev originally intended to build a wall. However, other sources show that Khrushchev was initially very wavering and worried that it would lead to negative reactions in the West. However, it is certain that Ubrich claimed that the East German regime was very unstable and decided to close the border for a while. Khrushchev has full confidence in the acquiescence of US President Kennedy and will not oppose this action in the Soviet-occupied area. On August 12, 1961, the East German leaders participated in a garden meeting of the government in the forests of the northern part of East Berlin. Ublich signed an order to block the border and began to build the wall. The code was codenamed \"Rose.\"",

Two large-scale slings rebellion occurred between 1648 and 1653, so Louis XIV decided to move the royal court out of the chaotic Paris city. After investigation and weighing, he decided to build a new palace based on Louis XIII's hunting palace in Versailles. For this purpose, 6.7 square kilometers of land were acquired. In 1667, Lenot designed the gardens and fountains of the Palace of Versailles. Levo added a new palace on the west, north and south sides of the hunting palace, enclosing the original hunting palace. The east facade of the original palace was preserved as the main entrance and a marble courtyard was built. In 1674, the architect Jules Hadrian Monsal took over the Versailles project from Levo, who died in 1670. He added the north and south wings of the palace, churches, orange gardens and large buildings. And built three radial avenues in front of the palace. In order to attract residents to settle in Versailles, a large number of residential and office buildings were built in the town of Versailles. In order to ensure the smooth construction of the Palace of Versailles, Louis XIV ordered the use of stone materials in other new buildings nationwide within 10 years.",

Although he lacked a national political base or important supportive force, his tireless efforts and planned campaigns led him to win a large number of votes and won the Democratic nomination in July 1976. Carter chose Minnesota's liberal US Senator Walter Mundell as his running mate, defeating incumbent President Gerald Ford in November 1976. On January 20, 1977, Carter was sworn in as the thirty-ninth president of the United States. On the second day after taking office, he specially escorted all the evaders of the Vietnam War. Major events during the term include the Iranian hostage crisis from 1979 to 1981, the energy crisis in 1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. During his presidency, Carter sought to strengthen his approachable image. When it was in public, he was dressed and talked informally, holding press conferences from time to time and avoiding the president's appearance. However, despite the fact that the Democratic Party has a majority in both the House and the Senate, Carter’s ambitious social, administrative, and economic reforms have been resisted in Congress, especially by the Democratic Party’s conservatives and Republicans blocking his bill. This led to several short-lived US government shutdowns.",

In terms of foreign affairs, although Carter’s international human rights have been valued by all parties, his main achievement is more practical endurance diplomacy. In 1977, the United States and Panama signed two treaties that allowed the latter to take over the Panama Canal at the end of 1999 and ensure that the canal was subsequently neutral. In 1978, President Carter announced that he had broken diplomatic relations with the Republic of China and admitted to the People's Republic of China without consulting the National Assembly or asking for congressional approval. The US Ambassador to the Republic of China, An Kezhi, informed the President of the Republic of China, Chiang Ching-kuo. Since this move is not in line with traditional diplomatic practices, Qian Fu, the former Foreign Minister of the Republic of China, has criticized this as a rude move. At the same time, the US Congress also passed an \"overwhelming majority\" through the \"Taiwan Relations Act,\" stipulating that if Taiwan's security is threatened, the United States has the obligation to assist Taiwan in self-defense, and Carter will later sign the bill. On January 1, 1979, formal diplomatic relations between the United States and the People’s Republic of China were established, and the official relations between the United States and the Republic of China were ended. The United States and the Republic of China were transferred to the newly established United States Association for Taiwan.",

In 1979, he signed a new bilateral strategic arms treaty with Brezhnev, the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in Vienna. Under the conditions that the two superpowers were able to fully check, they established the same strategic nuclear weapons launching system. However, these major successes in foreign policy were soon eclipsed by a serious diplomatic crisis and widespread dissatisfaction with Carter’s policies. On November 4, 1979, a group of Iranian students rushed into the US Embassy in Iran to detain the embassy staff. The atrocities of the students were immediately supported by the Iranian revolutionary government. Therefore, on the issue of trapped diplomats, the US and Iraq The distance between them is getting farther and farther. Carter’s response was to cater to delays, try to negotiate the release of hostages and avoid direct conflict with the Iranian government. This attitude was initially supported by the American public. However, after the failure of the US secret military rescue hostage in April 1980, Carter failed to obtain the release of the hostage, which became a major political burden. In 1979, when the Soviet Union entered Afghanistan, he took tougher measures to ban American grain from being sent to the Soviet Union and boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.",

Thomas Aquinas, the master of the medieval scholastic philosophy, is here to receive education. The main reason for making Louis IX famous is its devout \"saint\" image. According to records, Louis IX of the youth era is keen to fill the palace with luxurious furniture, like to wear beautiful and colorful costumes; not like reading, but loves hunting, hawking and various entertainment activities; even some people accuse him of flirting and debauchery until His mother took care of her wife. But it is such a prodigal boy who changed his habits after middle age and believed in Catholicism. Louis IX obeyed the religious rituals in the court, doing two masses every day, and getting up and praying at midnight. His worship of the sacred object reached a level of madness, so he spent a lot of money from the Byzantine emperor to buy items that were allegedly used by Jesus in the past, such as the crown of thorns, the spear, and the crucifixion of the crucifixion of Jesus, and so on. Specially built small sacred churches to celebrate these holy things.",

In addition, Cuvier worked with Alexander Bronnial, a professor at the Paris School of Mining, for many years, writing a monograph on geology around Paris. They published the first edition in 1808 and the final edition was published in 1811. In this monograph, they study the ordered layers of sedimentary rocks and the Paris basin by comparing the characteristic fossils of different rock formations and analyzing geological histograms. They found that these formations existed for a long time, during which time the fauna was succeeded. The area is sometimes submerged in sea water or fresh water. William Smith worked on the geological map of England during the same period. He also used the principles of characteristic fossils and fauna to correlate sedimentary rock formations. It helped establish the science of stratigraphy. This is a major development in paleontology and geology.",

The vanadium sound is translated from English Vanadium, whose roots are rooted in Vanadis, the goddess of the ancient Germanic language in Germanic mythology. The name stems from the fact that vanadium has many brightly colored compounds. Vanadium is a hard silver-gray transition metal with toughness and ductility. It exists only in a chemical state in nature and is generally used as a alloying component in materials engineering. In 1801, the Spanish mineralogist André Manuel de Leo first discovered vanadium in a lead mine in Mexico City, but he mistakenly thought that what he found was nothing more than an impure chromium. In 1831, the Swedish chemist Niels Gabriel Sevstrom re-discovered vanadium during a test with iron ore. In the same year, Friedrich Weiler confirmed the discovery of De Liou. In 1867, Henry Inverd Roscoe first obtained pure vanadium by reducing vanadium nitrite with hydrogen. Sevstrom has given vanadium the name of the beautiful goddess in the Germanic mythology, because the vanadium compounds are colorful.",

Jensen also signed a series of civil rights bills prohibiting racial discrimination in public facilities, interstate trade, workplaces and housing. The Voting Rights Act banned restrictions on African American suffrage in some southern states. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 reformed the US immigration system, ending the race-based immigration quota system, and implementing a system based on nationality. During Jensen’s term, the United States’ participation in the Vietnam War has gradually escalated. In 1964, the US Congress passed the \"Tokyo Bay Resolution\", giving Jensen the power to use force in Southeast Asia without a declaration of war. The number of military personnel in the United States has risen sharply, from 16,000 non-combat consultants in 1963 to 550,000 in early 1968, and a large number of military personnel were directly involved in the fighting. The amount of US military losses has also risen sharply, and the peace process has gradually reached a stalemate.

It is the part of the eye that converts light into a nerve signal. The retina contains rods and cones that can sense light. These cells convert the light they sense into neural signals. These signals are processed by other nerve cells on the retina and evolve into action potentials of retinal ganglion cells. The axons of retinal ganglion cells make up the optic nerve. The retina not only has a sensitizing effect, but it also plays an important role in vision. During morphogenesis, the retina and optic nerve extend from the brain. The structure of the blood vessels on the retina is different for each person and can therefore be used for biometric identification. The adult retina forms 72% of a sphere, which is about 22 mm in diameter. The center of the retina is where the optic nerve extends out of the eye. This point is also known as the blind spot because there are no photoreceptors. This point appears to be a white oval about 3mm2 large.",

Second, printing was invented and introduced in 1440, which brought about an information revolution. The ninety-five articles of Martin Luther and many of the booklets that were later written were quickly spread throughout Europe through printing. The Bible can also be printed in large quantities, theology. Homes, pastors, nobles and even many ordinary people are able to study on their own and bring about the liberation of ideas. Third, the medieval European religion is closely related to politics. This is derived from the tradition of the Roman Empire. Starting from Augustine, Christians accept this in their faith, which intensifies the reality of the unity of politics and religion. In this way, religious issues are derived into political issues. Fourth, the political power of Europe is scattered. Emperors, lords, and parliaments have checks and balances of power. There are also many autonomy in different churches and parishes within the church. When faced with very antagonistic choices, it is difficult for the entire empire to make a unified decision, and it is extremely easy for various power groups to become conflicts. Fifth, although there are many corruptions in the church, many people still take faith seriously. Monks, theologians, nobles, and knights in the monastery are very real and willing to use their lives to defend their faith.",

Early people found that chewing the seeds, bark or leaves of certain plants has the effect of reducing fatigue and refreshing. It was not until many years later that people discovered that using hot water to soak these plants could increase the effectiveness of caffeine. Many cultures have a myth about the discovery of these plants in ancient times. The history of tea can be traced back to the tea trees found in Yangshao culture. In the Tang Dynasty, Lu Yu mentioned in the \"Tea Classics\" that the history of tea as a drink \"was born in Shennong.\" In the Western Han Dynasty, tea has become a drink in the court. After the Jin Dynasty, tea gradually became a common drink. In addition, the early history of coffee is very vague, but a myth that spreads widely is related to the birthplace of Arabic coffee, Sobi. According to this mythology, a shepherd named Kadi found that when a goat eats berries on a coffee bush, it becomes very excited and insomnia at night, and the goat will continue to eat the berry again and experience the same vitality. The earliest written record about coffee may be Bunchum by Persian physician al-Razi in the 9th century. In 1587, Malaye Jaziri compiled a book on the history and legality of coffee, called Umdat al safwa fi hill al-qahwa. In this book, Jaziri records that Aden's Islam, Jamal-al-Din al-Dhabhani, was the first person to drink coffee in 1454. After the 15th century, Sufi Muslims in Yemen began to drink coffee regularly.

Caffeine also reduces the pain of headaches. The exact dose of caffeine required by each person to produce an effect is not the same, depending on body size and caffeine tolerance. Caffeine can begin to function in the body in less than an hour. If a mild dose of caffeine is taken, it can disappear within 3 to 4 hours. Eating caffeine does not reduce the amount of sleep required. It only temporarily reduces the feeling of sleepiness. Caffeine is sometimes mixed with other drugs to improve their efficacy. Caffeine can increase the effectiveness of headache-reducing drugs by 40% and allow the body to absorb these drugs faster and shorten the time it takes for these drugs to work. Therefore, many over-the-counter medications for headaches contain caffeine. Caffeine is also used in combination with ergotamine to treat migraine and cluster headaches and to overcome the difficulties caused by antihistamines.",

The main stream flows from the west to the east through the south of Shaanxi and Hubei, and is injected into the Yangtze River in Wuhan Hankou. It is 1577 kilometers long and has a drainage area of 159,000 square kilometers. The source of the Han nationality is traced back to Hanshui. Qin Huiwen Wang set Hanzhong County, the name was taken from Hanshui. After Liu Bang received Yu Yufeng in Ba, Yi and Hanzhong, they were all in Nanzheng of Hanzhong County. Because they were called Hanwang, they also used \"Han\" as the national name after the unification of the world. More than 400 years before and after the Han Dynasty, the economy, culture and territory have developed greatly. The former Central Plains inhabitants of China were called Han Chinese. The Han people have become the general name of the Chinese nationality. The origin of the name of the Han River and Hanshui can be traced back to the pre-Qin period.

In ancient civilizations, thunderstorms have great influence. Whether it is ancient China, ancient Rome or ancient civilizations of the Americas, there are myths related to thunderstorms. The life cycle of thunderstorms has three phases, namely cumulus phase, maturity phase and extinction phase. During the cumulus phase, the clouds warmer than the surrounding air, so the air inside the cloud accelerates upwards and quickly rises to a temperature much lower than the freezing point. Therefore, a large number of small water spots, ice crystals or snow flakes gather around the cloud, and there is only an increasing updraft without falling airflow.",

Many German Kalmyks were allowed to immigrate to the United States at the end of the Second World War.

For the next three hundred years Georgia has been involved in the war between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Persian Empire. Later, it was ruled by Arabs and Armenians; in 1220, the Mongol Empire invaded the Caucasus; from 1386 to 1403, it was attacked by Timur, and Georgia’s economy and culture were severely damaged, and it has never recovered.

The city wall was demolished by the Japanese during World War II. Walled City is the only town on the Kowloon Peninsula. Later, \"Kowloon City\" evolved into the name of the area where the Walled City is located. At present, Kowloon City is dominated by residential buildings. Due to its proximity to the former Kai Tak Airport, the buildings in the area have always had strict height restrictions, such as the rural areas, until the airport was relocated after the relocation on July 6, 1998. The building was completed. Kowloon City is located to the north of Ma Tau Wai and south of Lok Fu. It covers the Kowloon Walled City Park and the area along the Jai Bing Tat Road and Tai Wai Wai Road. It is in the vicinity of Tung Tau Estate and Tai Tung Estate, the predecessors of Tung Tau Estate and Mei Tung Estate. They are all regarded as part of Kowloon City. However, with the establishment of the district board system, Dongtou Village and Meidong Village are classified as Wong Tai Sin District based on factors such as population distribution. Therefore, it is generally not considered as the scope of Kowloon City. .

An editorial on this declaration said that \"China can't protect the ambassador from being miserable...

The hydropower stations built on Lake Brela and Lake Conoundo provided 90% of the country's electricity. Since 1990, due to the below-average rainfall and the impact of human activities such as residents' diversion and irrigation, the water levels in the two lakes began to decline. By 2004, the water level had dropped by 50%, resulting in a sharp drop in power plant capacity. Coupled with the increase in demand brought about by economic growth, there has been a serious power shortage in the country and a large-scale rotation blackout has to be carried out. The government installed diesel generators in the north of Kigali as an emergency measure. By 2006, it had been used to provide 56% of the country's electricity, but the cost of such power generation was too high. The government has also developed a number of measures to alleviate this problem, such as resettling residents, supplying water to Lake Brera and Confuto Lake, and investing in projects to extract methane from Lake Kivu, the first of which is the first. The phase is expected to increase national power generation by 40%. As of 2013, the country's population that can use electricity is still only 6%. After the genocide in 1994, the Luanda government increased its investment in domestic transportation infrastructure with the help of countries and organizations such as the United States, the European Union and Japan. The transportation system is dominated by road networks, connecting Kigali with most other major cities and towns across the country through paved roads. Luanda connects a number of East African countries including Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Kenya via roads, and connects to the eastern Congo cities of Goma and Bukavu. The country’s most important trade route is Pella and Nairobi reach the road to Mombasa.",

The historian Gérard Prunier believes that such a high population density is also one of the reasons for the 1994 genocide. Most of the country's population lives in rural areas, and there are still a few towns with relatively even population distribution. Only the savanna of Umtara and the Akagaila National Park in the east are sparsely populated. With a population of about 1 million, Kigali is the most populous city in the country. The rapid population growth has made Luanda’s infrastructure overwhelmed. Several other more famous cities include Gitarama, Butare City and Gisenyi, all with a population of less than 100,000. In 1990, Luanda's urban population accounted for 6%, and by 2006 it had increased to 16.6%. However, this proportion fell to 14.8% in 2011. Luanda has been a unified country since the colonial era. Its population belongs to the ethnic group and language group of Banja Luanda. Today, most African countries are divided by colonial countries and have no corresponding Ethnic boundaries or pre-colonial kingdoms.",

In 1961, the Belgians who stood on the Hutu side held a referendum in Luanda, and the referendum abolished the monarchy. In 1962, Luanda separated from Burundi and gained independence. What followed was a cycle of violence. The Tutsi in the neighboring countries launched an attack on the country, and the Hutu responded with a massive massacre and repression against the Tutsi in the country. In 1973, Juvenal Habyarimana came to power through a military coup. Discrimination against the Hutu family continues, but the state’s economic situation has improved and the violence against the Tutsi has also decreased. The Twa are still a marginalized group in the country. By 1990, they were almost completely expelled from the woods by the government, and many people were embarrassed.",

The total investment in construction safety is about 5 billion yuan, which was opened in early 2009. According to the \"Reference News\" report, the building was dubbed \"big pants\" by the Chinese because of its shape. Some media said that CCTV is collecting official names internally. In the Lantern Festival in 2009, the North Building of CCTV New Building took the lead in violating the fireworks and firecrackers in the event of fire, causing a firefighter to be derelict.

The bishops who attended attended and acknowledged: \"Jesus Christ, the Holy and the God, born to the Father, is not Build, be homogenous with the Father.\" After the meeting, the majority of the bishops of the Eastern Church rejected the Nicene Creed because of the key words used in the Grand Council - \"The Son and the Father are homogeneous.\" The Grand Council did not stop the dispute, and the dispute between Jesus and the Father continued. Athanasius took over as the bishop of Alexander in 328 AD and continued to argue that \"if Christ is the creator, he denies believing in him and is saved and united with God\", \"Christ was born from the essence of the Father\" and \"Christ is homogeneous with the Father.\" On the other hand, Emperor Constantine ended the exile of Aliu and resumed his duties.

The subsequent change in theological attitudes of Emperor Constantine and his successor to Constantine II were inclined to the Arian sects, and because of his bias, the forces of the Arian sect took the opportunity to take the plunge. Three tribes have arisen. Until the second meeting of the Grand Council in Constantinople in 380 AD, the personal character of Christ decided at the first meeting was reaffirmed, and the Holy Spirit was accepted as the Triune of the Trinity. The Aruba sect was once again dismissed as heresy. At this time, the theological thoughts of the Trinity have basically been established as orthodox teachings. Since then, the Arian sect has only existed among the Germans. Finally, in the 7th century AD, when the last monarch of the Iberian Peninsula believed in the conversion of the Arianist to the Catholic Church, the Aruba faction completely faded out in history. Another influence of the Arian sect set the norm for the Grand Council. Although the results of the meeting were arbitrary, all decisions were manipulated by the emperor and the emperor's adviser. However, the meeting's notice was recognized as a declaration of Christian authority.",

In 1964, the school adjusted the disciplines and simplified the original 12 departments into six departments: Department of Mathematics, Department of Physics, Department of Modern Chemistry, Department of Modern Physics, Department of Modern Mechanics, and Department of Radio Electronics. In that year, the total number of students in the school exceeded 3,000, and there were more than 800 teachers. In 1966, with the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, schools were inevitably affected. The distribution of graduates was postponed to the following year, admissions for undergraduate and graduate students were stopped, and schools were suspended. It was not until 1967 that some grades resumed classes. In 1970, the school moved to Hefei City, Anhui Province, and began the \"second venture.\" Under the severe impact of the Cultural Revolution and the requirements for war evacuation, despite the unanimous opposition of teachers and students, HKUST was forced to move out of Beijing in December 1969.",

In addition, North Korea began to shut down the country and only had a small amount of contact with the outside world. In the 200 years since Japan and Post-Golden invaded Korea, there has been no war on the Korean peninsula. Practical studies began to rise in North Korea. Early North Korean scholars advocated a series of reforms including imperial examinations, taxation, science and technology, and agricultural technology aimed at reviving the country where the captivity and the Jurchen were destroyed.

In the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the official use of the terms “Lee Dynasty”, “Lee Dynasty” or “North Korea Feudal Dynasty” is considered to be the fifth national subject and the second unified country in subject history. Due to political taboos, North Korea has never used the term \"Korean dynasty\", and the word \"feudal\" must be added between \"Korean\" and \"dynasty\". North Korea still claims that the great kings of the past have been recorded as \"Li Chao Shi Lu\". In the case of historical education, the name \"Li Chao feudal state\" was used when criticizing the feudal rulers. Once upon a time, at the end of the 14th century, the Goryeo Dynasty was in jeopardy due to years of war and the invasion of the Mongol Empire. In 1388, the Chinese Ming Dynasty special envoy asked Gao Li to return to Kaiyuan Road; Gao Lizhong Chen Cui Ying prepared to fight with Ming and sent Li Chenggui to attack the Liaodong Peninsula. Li Chenggui’s army suffered from heavy water on the Wahua Island. Soldiers were reluctant to expedition and there were many fugitives. Li Chenggui repeatedly requested the withdrawal of troops to return to China, but they were all rejected by Cui Ying, which eventually led Li Chenggui to launch a mutiny to overthrow the rule of the king of Gao Lijun, and Wang Wang, the son of Wang Hao, was king. After Li Chenggui discovered the attempt of Wang Chang’s restoration, Wang Hao and Wang Chang were executed and Wang Yao was the king.",

This time, the recovery of the Central Plains is the most successful and far-reaching one in the Northern Expedition of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and it was also impossible for many previous Northern Expeditions to match. In the five years of Yixi, the Nanyan emperor Murong Chao was sent to invade Suyu City in Huaibei because of the lack of Taile and the people. Later, he sent troops to attack Huaibei, and went to Yangping and Jinan, two counties, and captured more than a thousand. Liu Yu therefore went to the Northern Expedition and set off in April of the same year. At that time, Liu Yu believed that the Yan army was short-sighted and would not follow the Datun Mountain natural danger and the wall would be clear and wild. It would only enter Linyi and retreat to the city, and the action of the Nanyan Army was also true. Murong Chao knew that Jin Jun had passed through Datun Mountain and personally led the army to Linyi. Liu Yu striker defeated Yan Jun before the giant water, and then attacked Yucheng. The Jinyan and the two armies fought in the south of Linyi. Hu Yu offered a surprise attack on the city of Linyi, and finally succeeded in conquering. Murong Chao Canghuang escaped from the city to the south of the city. At this time, Liu Yu ordered the army to attack, defeating the Yan army and killing the ten. Many generals, Murong Chao then fled back to Guanggu. Liu Yu then pursued the victory to Guanggu and successfully conquered his outer city. Murong Chao defended the small city, and Liu Yu built a wall to encircle the land. Liu Yu’s siege war was maintained until February of the following year when he captured Guanggu and captured Murong Chao and destroyed Nanyan.",

Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Lin Biao, Deng Xiaoping and Peng Zhen, Peng Dehuai, He Long, Luo Rongzhen, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Chen Boda, Ye Jianying and Huang Kecheng attended the meeting. The working arrangements of Zhou Enlai and others were discussed at the meeting. Participants agreed that Zhou Enlai \"should continue to work as an incumbent and there is no need to change it.\" However, Zhou Enlai was removed from the position of the head of the Central Financial and Economic Leading Group and the Foreign Minister before and after, and lost the right to speak for economic work for a period of time. From 1960 to 1964, in order to correct the mistakes in the \"Great Leap Forward\" and reverse the economic difficulties, Premier Zhou Enlai and President Liu Shaoqi and General Secretary Deng Xiaoping led the adjustment of the national economy and gradually restored and developed the national economy. From August to September 1960, he presided over the formulation of the eight-character policy of \"adjusting, consolidating, enriching, and improving\" the national economy. This policy was adopted at the 9th Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in January 1961.",

Because the ventricle plays a major role in pumping blood from the heart, the cardiac cycle is seen as the active cycle of the ventricles. The atria and ventricles each have a diastolic and systolic phase in a cardiac cycle. The activities of the atrial ventricles are sequential, but the activities of the left and right atrium and the ventricles are synchronized. Take a normal psychological cycle of 0.8 seconds as an example: a cardiac cycle begins with the contraction of two atriums, a process that lasts 0.1 seconds, followed by a 0.7 second relaxation. Shortly after the atrial begins to relax, the ventricles begin to contract for 0.3 seconds. This systolic phase can be divided into: isovolumic systolic and ejection phases, which will be described later. The ventricle then dilated for 0.5 seconds. The first 0.4 seconds of ventricular diastole is called the whole heart diastolic period, because the atria is also in the diastolic phase. Isovolumic systole, during which the ventricle continues to contract, but the pressure is still not enough to rush into the pulmonary artery or aorta. On the other hand, this pressure causes the tricuspid and mitral valves to close because the diastolic atrium provides less pressure than the ventricle that is beginning to contract. Closure of the flap prevents blood from flowing back from the ventricle to the atria. The ventricular volume is constant during this period. This is also the origin of its name. Can be so associated: grab a water ball with your hand, but the water ball has not broken. The volume of the water polo does not change during the process.",

Lowering and lowering blood pressure, etc. When the concentration of sodium ions or plasma in the blood increases, the venous return increases, causing the atrial myocytes to be elongated and stimulated, thereby secreting ANP. ANP reaches the kidney through the blood circulation, inhibits the renal tubules from reabsorbing sodium ions and water, increases the urine flow, and helps the blood volume return to normal. ANP inhibits the secretion of renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, and vasopressin, which indirectly reduces the reabsorption of sodium ions. ANP can also relax the mesangial cells of the spheroid, increase the effective area of filtration, and increase the sodium ion discharge. In addition, ANP reduces the effective response of vascular smooth muscle to vasoconstrictors, thereby lowering blood pressure. There is also ANP in the anterior lobes of the brain and in the brain, but its role remains unknown.",

In 1172, Adrian IV's successor, Alexandre III, reconfirmed the predecessor's decree. When Henry VIII was in office, he intended to terminate the marriage with Queen Catherine, rejected by Pope Clement VII. Therefore, Henry VIII declared England to leave the Catholic Church and become a \"global church leader in England.\" But in 1533, the Pope expelled Henry VIII from the Catholic Church. Henry VIII also did not recognize the Pope’s sovereignty over Ireland. Therefore, the British king’s legal suspicion from the Pope’s title of the Irish lord led to a constitutional crisis in Ireland.

Although most of its political significance and importance were lost because of the Second World War, it became an important industrial, commercial, and trade hub in Europe after the war. It is now one of Italy's industrial centers, and it has formed an \"industrial iron triangle\" with Milan and Genoa. Economically speaking, Doolin is the third largest city in Italy after Rome and Milan. Its GDP is as high as 58 billion US dollars, ranking 78th in the world. Although not as a \"world-class city\" as Rome and Milan, GaWC rated it as \"fit for development\". Doolin is the cradle of the Italian automobile manufacturing industry, known as the \"City of Italy\" or \"Detroit of Italy\". It is the headquarters of the car brands Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo.

Du Lin was not liberated until the Allied Forces' offensive in Italy in the spring of 1945. On April 25, 1945, the major uprisings were held in major cities in northern Italy, and the Italian resistance movement liberated Doolin and got rid of the rule of the Nazi fascists. After the Second World War, Doolin quickly rebuilt and became a symbol of the economic miracle of Italy. Thousands of immigrants flooded into the city and became workers in the automobile industry and other corporate workers. In 1960, the urban population reached 1 million. In 1974, the urban population reached 1.2 million. Since most of the immigrants came from southern Italy, Diego Noveli, then mayor of Doolin, joked that Du Lin \"is the third largest city in southern Italy after the population, after Napoli and Palermo.\" In the 1970s and 1980s, the auto industry crisis hit Duolin heavily, causing a sharp drop in urban population by a quarter. In recent years, the problem of insufficient population that has long plagued cities has eased. The urban population increased from 865,000 in 2001 to 910,000 in 2009. In February 2006, Doolin held the 20th Winter Olympic Games and held the 9th Winter Paralympics in March of the same year.",

For example, the Hungarian Socialist Party, which was reorganized by the Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party, and the Bulgarian Socialist Party, which was reorganized by the Bulgarian Communist Party, have long been in a ruling position under multi-party politics; others have adopted nationalist policies and evolved into pro-nationalist parties.

Although some have changed their flags, they have continued to carry out long-term one-party dictatorship, such as the Turkmen Democratic Party, which was reorganized by the former Turkmen Communist Party. The Communist Party of China, in the form of multi-party cooperation and Communist leadership, evaded the name of one-party dictatorship. But the substance remains the same. In addition, the former Central and Eastern Europe region still has some small parties that fully adhere to the orthodox Marxism-Leninism, but it is considered to have no significant impact on the local area. In some developing countries, there are some Communist political forces based on the theory of \"Maoism\", such as the Communist Party of Nepal and the Bangladesh Workers' Party. Among them, the Communist Party of Nepal has great influence. The party inherited the thought of Mao Zedong, the former leader of the Communist Party of China, on guerrilla warfare. He launched the \"People's War\" to force the king to step down and obtain the ruling power through universal free universal suffrage. Another Nepalese Communist Party in Nepal, similar to the European communist party, also held the position of head of government three times. There are differences and cooperation between the two political parties, whether in parliamentary politics or street politics.",

As a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have far-reaching influence in human culture and can still be seen in current language and semiotics. Sheep are most often associated with pastoral songs. In some myths, sheep are seen. In religion, sheep are often used as sacrifices. In the New Testament, Jesus mentioned the parable of the sheep, and the person who can be saved is like a sheep. Because of its large size and slow reproduction, sheep is not an ideal research object, nor is it a common model organism. However, they play an important role in individual scientific categories. For example, the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland, facilitated the use of sheep for a number of research projects with breakthroughs in genetic engineering. In 1995, two sheep called Megan and Morag were copied from differentiated cells. Although they are not copied using adult cells, their birth indicates that this technology is practical. A year later, a Finnish Dorset special, known as Dolly's sheep, became the global focus, and was even named by Scientific American magazine as \"probably the most famous sheep in the world.\" Dolly is the first mammal in the world to be successfully replicated by adult somatic cells. A year later, Baoli and Morley were a pair of replica sheep that included both adult somatic cell replication and gene transfer technology.",

In the early period of the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to the Soviet aviation volunteers going to China to participate in the war, the National Government also tried to recruit foreign pilots as the core of the combat troops, but the recruited troops were extremely poor, so they were disbanded in 1938; until 1941, Chen Nade won the US President. Roosevelt’s approval was to agree to recruit organizations to organize American volunteers to participate in the war against Japan. At the end of 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. After the United States officially participated in the Allied countries, the 12th period of the Republic of China Air Force from the official school began to train students to provide more complete flight education. At the same time, the United States officially assisted all types of fighters for the operation of the Republic of China, in order to replace the Soviet-made aircraft.

Its Nissan and Infiniti brands have been dramatically reborn, so this phenomenon is called by mainstream economists. One of the most successful corporate revival cases in history. In 2002, the company launched the Nissan 180 Plan on the basis of the Nissan Recovery Plan. Ghosn is therefore regarded by the Japanese as a hero in Japan's sluggish economy. The story of his revival with Nissan also appears in Japanese manga and pop culture. Today, the Nissan Yokohama headquarters is flying the French flag and the Japanese flag. On April 7, 2010, Renault-Nissan and Daimler joined the world's third-largest auto alliance, with a cross-shareholding of 3.1%. Daimler will issue a total of 32.9 million shares, accounting for 3.1% of the total equity ratio. Up to 1.17 billion euros, Renault and Nissan split equally, and Daimler also received 3.1% of Renault's new shares and Nissan's current shares. Japan produced a large number of mainstream cars and trucks, initially serving the domestic market and exporting to the world from the 1950s. The company also produces several sports cars, including the Z series and the GT-R. The former is a relatively economical sports car that first appeared in 1969, while the latter is a powerful four-wheel sports four-seater. In 1985, Nissan created a new division called NISMO, which specializes in racing and its development. The luxury brand \"INFINITI\" sold by Nissan is infinite. Nissan has a number of other products besides cars, such as the TuKa mobile phone service that began in 1994 and was later sold to KDDI in 1999. Nissan also owns the Nissan Shipping Company, which together with Marubeni produces marine engines and other marine equipment.",

Some people challenge this view, with special emphasis on people reading, receiving and interpreting cultural texts in different ways. A consumer can misappropriate, actively abandon and challenge the meaning of a product. This route shifts focus from the production of the item to the other. They believe that consumption is equally important, because the way consumers consume products will give meaning to the item. Some people have a close connection between production activities and identity. Stewart Hull has a great influence in this regard. Some critics will describe the transformation of this meaning as a cultural turn. In the context of cultural studies, the concept of \"text\" is not just written, but also includes film, photography, fashion, or hairstyle; the text of cultural studies contains all meaningful cultural artifacts. Similarly, the concept of \"culture\" has also been expanded. For a cultural researcher, \"culture\" is not just the so-called exquisite art and pop art, but also all the daily meanings and activities. In fact, the latter has become the main research object in cultural studies. In another slightly different but different usage, the term cultural studies is sometimes used as a synonym for regional studies. The term regional research is used to refer to academic research conducted on a particular culture, such as Islamic studies, Asian studies, African studies, and so on.",

Taoists often have to keep their hair, and they are arrogant, emphasizing meditation and repair. In addition, there is a Quanzhennan faction, which can marry a wife and have children.

Professor Merton of English Language and Literature. He is a close friend of C.S. Louis, both of whom are members of the \"signs\" of informal literary circles. On March 28, 1972, Tolkien was awarded the Order of the British Empire by the Queen Elizabeth II. After his father's death, Tolkien's son Christopher compiled a large number of notes and unpublished manuscripts, and published a series of works, including \"The Elf Diamond\", \"Unfinished Story\", \"Hulin Children\" Wait. Together with the Adventures of the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, these works form a connected community consisting of legends, poems, fictional history, man-made language and essays on a fantasy world called Alda. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien used the term \"legendary story\" to refer to most works. Despite the advent of many other authors' fantasy works before him, the great success of the Habib Adventures and The Lord of the Rings has contributed to the popularity and revival of this literary type. Therefore, Tolkien was recognized by the public as \"the father of modern fantasy literature.\" In 2008, The Times listed him as the 6th in the list of the 50 greatest British writers after 1945.

Sources of inspiration include Old English literature such as Beowulf, Nordic Sakya such as \"Walsonge Legend\", \"Hayval and Hedrick Legend\", \"Old Edda\", \"Psal Eda\" and Old German \"The Song of Nibelungen\" and so on. Although Tolkien's work has many similarities with \"Walsonge Legend\" and \"The Song of Nibelungen\", he opposes critics who directly compare his work with Wagner's work and tell publishers \"The two rings are all ring-shaped. There is nothing in common except this.\" However, some critics believe that Tolkien should be grateful for some of the elements of Wagner's vision, such as \"the ring that can give power to the world.\" This concept. The two characteristics of the Supreme Lord of the Rings, the evil of its essence and the corrosive power of the soul, did not appear in all myths, but it was the main plot of Wagner's opera. Tolkien also confirmed the influence of several non-Germanic cultures. He quoted the tragedy of the ancient Greek writer Sophocles, \"Oedipus the King\" as the source of inspiration for \"The Elf Diamond\" and \"Hulin's Children.\" At the time of King Edward's school, Tolkien first read the English translation of the Finnish national epic Kalevala. Its main character, Wiener Morin, is one of the prototypes of Gandalf, according to Tolkien himself. One of the anti-hero characters, Kulver, is the prototype of Turin Tulum. Many outstanding scholars who studied Tolkien believe that Tolkien also draws inspiration from Celtic history and legend. Part of the reason for the rejection of \"The Elf Diamond\" was the name of the Celtic, which was complicated and difficult to read.",

At that time, he was learning Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Interest in the language quickly faded, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented a more complex language called Nevbosh. Then he created the Naffarin language by himself. In 1911, when he was at King Edward's school, Tolkien and three friends, Robert Gilson, Joffrey Bach Smith and Christopher Weisman created a semi-secret society called TCBS. . The name is an acronym for \"Tea Club and Barro Society\", which implies that they like to shop at the Barro store near the school and secretly drink tea at the school library. After graduation, members of the community remain in contact. In December 1914, they held a \"parliament\" at the home of Wisman in London. This gathering allowed Tolkien to dedicate himself to poetry. In 1911, the census of England and Wales showed that Tolkien and his brother Hillary lived at Hayfield 4 in Egbaston. In the same year, Tolkien spent the summer vacation in Switzerland. In a letter from 1968, he vividly recalled the trip and wrote that Bilbo’s journey across the Misty Mountains was directly based on a group of 12 people walking from Interlaken to Lu. Dabanna, the ultimate adventure of the camp on the ice outside of Mirren. They passed through the \"Little Watershed Pass\" to the town of Grindelwald and then walked past the Dashou Pass to Meilingen. They then walked past the Grimsey Pass, through the northern part of the Valais to Brig, to the Aletsch Glacier and Zermatt. In October of the same year, Tolkien began his studies at the University of Oxford at Exeter College.

Because of the unpredictability of this kind of private property, some people think that land rights should be reformed to privatize the land.

However, the household registration system has created a gap between urban and rural areas and the closure of the area. It has created obstacles to the work and residence of many migrants, and has restricted and violated the rights of citizens to migrate and live to a considerable extent. There are quite a few regions that implement temporary housing systems to limit civil liberties.

Members of some countries, including the United States, have proposed to refuse to issue visas to Chinese people who have taken prisoners’ body organs. In mainland China, the people have no right to run private newspapers and TV stations. The media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and the government. It is known as the \"mouthpiece\" of the authorities. The news agencies are only Xinhua News Agency and China News Service. However, because many newspapers and magazines have been required to be responsible for their own profits and losses, criticisms of the government and policies have often appeared in order to earn income. In places such as Guangdong, where public opinion is relatively loose, some media are called the Southern Department because of their style of daring. Some official media have also begun to criticize the government's faults and mistakes, such as CCTV's focus interviews and other public opinion monitoring programs. The threshold for individuals and independent organizations to run media is high. The \"News Law\" was called 20 years ago, but until now the authorities still have not legislated on this. According to the official spokesperson of the authorities, the \"News Law\" is not in the legislative plan. The state of freedom of the press in China has led to negative criticism from many organizations.",

With the advancement of agriculture and animal husbandry in production, men gradually replaced women to achieve social dominance, and the patriarchal clan commune was formed. In the paternal clan commune, the origin and the lineage are calculated according to the man's system, and the patriarchal property inheritance system is implemented. The husband and wife family system has become a woman's family system, and the unstable dual marriage has gradually transitioned to monogamy or polygamy. The status of women has gradually declined. The patriarchal clan leader has been replaced by a man. The clan council has been composed of the patriarchs of the major families. The clan council, which was originally attended by all adult men and women, is now attended by all adult men. With the development of production, the product has surplus, and collective labor has gradually been replaced by individual labor, which has led to private ownership, and then there has been class. Aristocratic and civilian classes have emerged in the clan. At the end of the period, the clan formed by blood relationship began to break down. Some clan members were separated from their clan, and they lived elsewhere with people who had no blood relationship with them. At the same time, the clan also accepted foreigners, and rural communes were formed by region. By this time, the primitive society has basically collapsed, and there has been a struggle between different classes. As the situation deepens, the country has come to effectively rule the people. After the disintegration of the primitive society of many civilizations, they entered the slave society.",

He curbed the wave of Europeans moving inland and limited their living area to the coast. Napoleon also released Abdul Kadir, the leader of the local rebels, and issued him a pension of 150,000 francs a year. He allowed Muslims to join the army in a theoretically equal position, join government agencies, and immigrate to France. Muslims can even have citizenship, but in doing so they must abide by French civil law and not recognize Sharia courts. Some angry Muslims interpret his approach as acquiring citizenship and giving up faith. Napoleon’s most influential Algerian policy was to change the land property system. This approach was superficial, but actually destroyed the local traditional land management system and took away many indigenous lands. He gave up the state's property rights to tribal land and supported the government to dismantle tribal property rights into individual property rights within three generations. Most of the land classified as public property was occupied by immigrants, and local French officials favored these immigrants, which undermined Napoleon’s policies. French officials have appointed tribal leaders, and the most important thing is the degree of pro-law, not influence. Many tribal leaders sold the land of the tribe immediately after taking office.",

In 1858, he approved Charlie Rigor de Jean-Uy's interest rate led fleet to expedition to Da Nan, in order to retaliate against the persecuted French missionaries and force the local government to accept the French influence. Napoleon believes that if France does not establish influence in East Asia, it will eventually become a second-rate country. Moreover, the French shoulder the mission of spreading civilization. In 1861, the French army attacked Annan comprehensively. In 1862, at the end of the war, Da Nan was forced to ceduce three southern provinces to France, and the French called the area a cross. Da Nan also opened three trading ports at the same time, allowing French warships to freely enter and exit Cambodian waters, giving French missionaries freedom of movement and compensating for French military spending. However, France did not intervene in the Vietnamese Christian outbreak in Tokyo, allowing the local government to suppress the insurgents, causing thousands of Christians to be killed, causing dissatisfaction among the missionaries. On the Chinese side, France joined forces with the United Kingdom to enter Beijing in the second Opium War. China was forced to make more concessions in terms of trade rights, while allowing Western vessels to enter the Yangtze River, give Christians equal status, and surrender huge sums of money to Britain and France. France's involvement in Vietnam has provided France with a platform to exert influence on China. South China eventually became the sphere of influence of France. In 1866, North Korea executed several French missionaries. In order to punish North Korea, French diplomats stationed in China, without the approval of Paris, sent a naval force to intervene in local affairs but failed. As a result, France’s influence declined locally. In 1867, France sent a military delegation to the shogunate to assist the shogunate in carrying out military reforms.",

Napoleon then asked Hohenzollern dynasty leader William I to assure that no other members of the Hohenzollern dynasty would be on the throne of Spain, and that his rude attitude surprised William I. After meeting with the French ambassador, William I wrote a telegram with a content that rejected Napoleon’s request. However, in order to provoke Napoleon, Bismarck revised the wording of the telegraph, causing the French public opinion to be stunned and the Franco-Prussian war broke out. When Napoleon and the French generals were in the war, they all had great confidence in winning. Napoleon made a crucial mistake in keeping the command of the chaotic army in his own hands. He also has no experience in commanding large-scale military operations, and his spirit often has problems. He did not listen to the advice. As a result, the French army was defeated in several important battles, and the well-equipped and well-trained generals drove straight. Napoleon refused to return to Paris and refused to hand over military power. On September 2, 1870, he was captured by the generals in the Battle of Sedan.

In order to stabilize his position, Louis Napoleon confiscated all the property of the members of the Orleans dynasty on January 22, 1852.

Dujiangyan and the Taoist holy land Qingcheng Mountain were listed as World Heritage Sites in 2000. Dujiangyan City is also one of China's national historical and cultural cities. Due to the close proximity to the source of the earthquake, the Wenchuan Earthquake was hit hard. After the earthquake, Jiangyan City issued a comprehensive plan for post-disaster reconstruction. In 2009, the economy recovered and surpassed the pre-earthquake level. In 2015, GDP reached 27.538 billion, the third. The industry added value is the main factor. Dujiangyan City, formerly known as Guanxian County, has a long history. It was renamed Dujiangyan City in 1988 with Dujiangyan. The Dujiangyan Water Conservancy Project, built during the Warring States Period, has been used for flood control irrigation for the Chengdu Plain and the Sichuan Basin for more than two thousand years. The world-famous Dujiangyan Water Conservancy Project is located in the plains of the Lancang River and was designed and built by the son of Li Bing and Li Bing of Qin Guofan County in the Warring States Period. The project \"Shen Tao Beach, Low Operation\" features \"No Dam Water Diversion\". After the Yangtze River passed through this hub, in addition to the Jinma River continued to be a main stream, another six rivers were used to irrigate farmland, becoming the cornerstone of the prosperity of the Chengdu Plain, a country of abundance, which has played a huge role for more than 2,000 years.",

The eastern part of the province is adjacent to Ontario, Western Saskatchewan, Nunavut in the north, northwest in the northwest, and North Dakota and Minnesota in the south. In addition to English, although French was once one of the official languages in the early days of the province, this norm was abolished at the end of the 19th century.

Today's Manitoba is dominated by agriculture and animal husbandry and is Canada's most important grain barn. Indigenous people have lived in Manitoba for thousands of years before the arrival of European colonists. Until the end of the 17th century, fur traders arrived in the area, when it was part of the Rupert area and belonged to the Hudson Bay Company in 1670. In 1867, negotiations on the establishment of Manitoba led to the armed uprising of the Meti people against the Canadian government, a conflict known as the Red River rebellion. The rebellion led to the passage of the Manitoba Act by the Canadian Parliament in 1870, marking the official creation of Manitoba.

In northern Manitoba, quartz mines are mined to make arrows. Manitoba's initial agriculture appeared along the Red River, planting corn and other crops before coming into contact with European settlers. In 1611, Henry Hudson arrived in Hudson Bay, one of the first Europeans to arrive in Manitoba. On the return trip, there were two rebellions on the ship. Henry was exiled by the crew to the North American waters. The whereabouts are unknown. The first European to reach the central and southern Manitoba was Sir Thomas. He went up the Lake of Nissen in 1612 and went up to Lake Winnipeg to try to search and rescue Hudson, but he failed. When the British trade vessel Nonsuch entered Hudson Bay between 1668 and 1669, it became the first trade vessel to reach the area. The voyage marks the establishment of the Hudson Bay Company, through which the UK government has complete control over the entire Hudson Bay Basin. The basin was named Rupert to commemorate Prince Rupert, who had heavily funded the Hudson Bay Company and has been involved in the local fur trade for the next few centuries.

This has led to a significant reduction in the amount of water flowing into the Aral Sea. From 1960 to 1970, the water level in the Aral Sea decreased by 20 centimeters per year; from 1970 to 1980, the rate of decline surged to 50-60 centimeters per year. In 1980, the drop in water levels soared to 80-90 cm per year. However, at the same time, the amount of cotton planted has increased significantly. In 1987, the Aral Sea was divided into two parts, the South and the North, known as the South Aral Sea and the North Aral Sea. Since then, artificial channels have been used to reconnect the two lakes, but eventually they were separated again in 1999 as they continued to shrink. In 2003, the North Aral Sea was divided into east and west sides. In October of the same year, Kazakh announced a $260 million rescue plan to build an artificial dam to completely separate the East and West Lakes and completed them in 2005. The move successfully increased the sea area of the North Aral Sea from 2,550 square kilometers in 2003 to 3,300 square kilometers in 2008, an increase of 30%. The depth of the sea has also increased from the original 30 meters to 42 meters, which also saved the local fishing industry, allowing nearly 100 fishermen to return to their livelihoods. In addition, due to the increase of the lake, the rainfall in the area is slowly recovering. It is planned to plant the local shrub species saxaul in the dry seabed to accelerate the coverage of the vegetation, which is expected to accelerate the rate of natural recovery and attract other plants and animals. On the other hand, the South Aral Sea is still declining due to the fiscal tightening of the Uzbek government. The exposed riverbed has a large amount of salt sand, which greatly increases the impact of sandstorms. In 2014, the eastern shore of the South Aral Sea was dried up for the first time in 600 years. It is expected that the Aral Sea will completely disappear from the earth in 2020.",

Efficient air-rail combined transport requires not only a sound infrastructure, but also the cooperation and coordination of the airport, railway and aviation operations. Air-rail combined transport can not only improve the proportion of public transport to and from the airport, improve airport ground transportation and airport accessibility, but also continuously expand the market radiation range of hub airports, expand and stabilize market resources, improve the competitiveness of hub airports, and benefit hubs. Sustainable development of the airport. Air-rail combined transport can effectively reduce direct competition between air transport and rail transport, especially high-speed rail. Avoiding the opening of high-speed railways directly leads to the suspension of routes. Both the air and the iron have their own advantages in terms of functions. In most parts of the world, the railways are well-connected. Most cities and towns have access to trains, which can spread scattered aviation target customers to a regional airport.

Moreover, the large and sturdy casing and gun structure can be used with high-pressure and high-loading of standard pistols of the same appearance and size, suitable for close-range sniper missions, and the actual effective range is up to 100 meters. The special new bullets have a personal defense weapon of up to 200 meters, and both of them can run through most of the body armor in close range. The model that uses the subsonic bullet in reverse or the subsonic bullet, because of the longer barrel, can be opened with a small hole to install a dedicated suppressor. Therefore, the submachine gun is often used by the special police team for counter-terrorism or security tasks. The gun type of the intermediate type of powerful bullets is similar to the standard assault rifle, but in fact it is difficult to hit the target of 300 meters because the gun is too short and light. But because the imaginary enemy is also using the automatic rifle, the military often welcomes this type of gun. At present, the general books refer to the use of pistol bullets from the perspective of the victors of the two wars, but they can be used with higher power than standard bombs, including high-powered strong bombs and armor-piercing warheads or individuals. A special bomb for defensive weapons, with a rifle-like butt and guard or front grip and a barrel length close to the rifle, a firearm that can be fired, and many more actually modified by assault rifles, such as Colt 9mm submachine gun and PP-19-01 Warrior submachine gun. This also means that the usual submachine gun belongs to the carbines, and the concept is also close to the later personal defense weapons.

The so-called ultra-small submachine guns based on this concept often have no stocks and ultra-short barrels, no protective wood or front grips, and their semi-automatic models are positioned as pistols, and usually only standard pistols can be used. Or reduce the bombs and even low-fire pistols. There is no universally accepted consensus on the definition of submachine guns in countries around the world. According to the definition of \"Ci Hai·Military Volume\" published in mainland China in 1978, the submachine gun is \"a single soldier with a foot, usually equipped with a speed machine, a pistol bullet or a medium rifle,\" It can be seen that the Chinese mainland did not accept the concept of NATO's \"Assault Rifle\". The official Chinese name of the Soviet version of the AK-47 assault rifle authorized to manufacture the version 56 automatic rifle was the \"Five-Six-type assault rifle\", which was mentioned in the Vietnam News-related news report. The US M-16 assault rifle is usually also referred to as a \"submachine gun.\" According to this standard, the main difference between a submachine gun and an automatic rifle is the type of ammunition and the tripod; only the type of gun that uses full-length rifle bullets does not standardize the tripod, such as the US system. The White Langing automatic rifle will be called the \"automatic rifle\". After the 1990s, in consideration of international standards, the Chinese mainland also began to use \"automatic rifles\" to describe the type of guns using intermediate ammunition, such as the 95-type automatic rifle. However, the old classification method has been customary, and even in the PLA forces. There is still the name of the \"95 submachine gun\".",

This kind of demand began to reveal its value in the last large-scale battles at the end of the First World War. The Germans were equipped with a large number of submachine guns on the infantry that carried out the assault tactics, and successfully threatened the Allied forces, but because of the American battles that occurred during the same period. The shotgun overwhelmed the submachine gun on firepower, and when the strategic advantage of the submachine gun was still not fully revealed, the first battle was over.

Using the improved launch system of the HK G3 automatic rifle series produced by H&K, the MP5 has made great progress in shooting accuracy and overall performance compared to the early submachine gun. Therefore, the MP5 series made a big splash in the hostage incident at the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980. The British Army Special Air Force, which carried out the tough task, held the MP5 for the attack. The lens was officially exposed by the mass media and obtained special operations from the police and the military.

In April 1927, due to the failure of the Japanese government to relieve Taiwanese banks, the country’s financial crisis was in danger, and the history was called “Showa Financial Panic”; In 1930, the world economy fell into a severe recession and Japan was not spared. During this period, Hamaguchi, the dog raising and the Okada cabinet rescued the economy, advocated the reduction of military expenses, and dissatisfied the military and right-wing organizations. The three men were also assassinated. In 1931, the Japanese army launched the September 18 Incident, invaded Northeast China, and supported the country's Manchuria. In 1932, it launched the January 28 Incident in Shanghai. The political party politics is gradually declining.

It is estimated that the number of people killed was about 300,000. The National Revolutionary Army led by Jiang Zhongzheng can only retreat to the southwest of China. However, the aftermath of the war was stalemate, causing the Japanese army to fall into a war of attrition; it was prolonged and consumed a lot of manpower, material and financial resources of the Japanese army, and the embargo, oil and steel from Europe and the United States could not be shipped to Japan. Therefore, the military made a desperate attempt to launch the \"Greater East Asian War\" and continued to expand to South Asia, known as the Pacific War.",

In addition to the Ryukyu Islands, the whole island entered the next Jomon period. The period from around the third century BC to around the third century AD was called the Yayoi era. The name of the era division is derived from the Yayoi pottery that was considered to be characteristic during this period. In 1884, in the Yayo-cho, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, this pottery was first discovered, hence the name. During this period, the farming society, centered on rice cultivation, spread rapidly from the northern Kyushu to the Japanese archipelago. The Yayoi era, according to the form of pottery, can be divided into three periods: front, middle and back. In the early period, it expanded from Kyushu to Kinki area, and the middle stage spread to the northeast. The flat-grained stone axe and other stone-grinding tools, bronzes and the dykes of the former Kitakyushu are similar to the mainland culture. Yayoi culture has advanced farming techniques from the very beginning, and is generally considered to be influenced by immigrants from North Korea, Wuyue and the Central Plains Han Chinese. After the medium-term irrigation technology advancement, agricultural production has become more stable. In the later period, iron farm tools became popular, and stone tools basically disappeared. Bronze ceremonies such as bronze gongs, bronze swords, copper spears, and copper gems are developed, and social divisions such as iron making and salt making appear. Form a unified political regional group through transactions and wars. At this time, Hokkaido is still unable to grow rice, and it is still in the stage of rope pattern culture.

The main achievement of Kishishinsuke is to amend the Japan-US security treaty. To this end, the two major forces of innovation and conservatives have finally confronted each other, and the largest social movement in the modern history of Japan has emerged as a \"security struggle\", and there has been a continuous student movement. Subsequently, the revision of the Japan-US security treaty naturally took effect.

After Ikeda played, facing the social confrontation left by Kishi Shinsuke, he put forward the slogan of \"tolerance and patience.\" The rapid economic growth is also known as the economic power. Ikeda has formed a cabinet three times in a row, and even competed with Sato Wakamoto, who is under the same name of Yoshida Mao, in the presidential election of the Liberal Democratic Party, and finally had to resign because of throat cancer. Sato is a successor. After Sato’s formation, Japan’s economy rose further and the United States returned to Okinawa. For the fourth time in a row, Sato has been selected as the president of the Democratic Party and has formed a cabinet for three consecutive times. His term of office has also exceeded that of the teacher Shita Mao and the Meiji era of the Meiji era. After he announced his retirement, the Liberal Democratic Party had five presidential candidates. They were Sato's Tanaka Kakuei, Daping's Daping Zhengfang, Futian's Futian Fufu, and Sanmu's Sanmu Wufu. Four people participated in the presidential election. As a result, only Tanaka and Fukuda were out of the line. The world was called the Kokfu War. Tanaka Kakuei successfully wooed Daping, Miki and Nakasone Yasuhiro to defeat the president of Fukuda.",

Originally the leader of the ancient clan in the Chinese legend era, he became the ancestor of humanity in Chinese mythology. According to the records of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the son-in-law is the sister and spouse of Fuxi. The main merits of the head of the snake body are the martyrdom of the earth, the stone-making of the earth, the killing of the black dragon, the smashing of the scorpion, the breaking of the giant poles, the accumulation of ash and the sinister water. Invented the spring. As well as creating a marriage, such as an umbrella, the son-in-law is good at filling the sky, so the son-in-law has also become a professional god worshipped by umbrellas and embroiderers in Taiwan. In the mainland of China, there is the mausoleum of the imperial concubine in the Hou Village of Zhaocheng Town, Hongdong County, Linyi City, Shanxi Province, and the country-level temple that has been worshipped and worshipped by the emperors of the dynasties for thousands of years. Other cultures in Shanxi have seen the culture of the goddess. Other achievements include the invention of springs and rules, and the creation of marriages. The later son-in-law became a god in folk beliefs and worshipped as the ancestor of mankind and the god of marriage. According to the Taoist collection of the son-in-law, the ancient goddess was once the emperor. It is one of the ancient gods and became a god in the beliefs of later generations. Many people in Taoism and worship are offering. As of July 2014, the religious system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China has a total of seven temples in the temples of Taiwan and Taiwan. It is also an important god of Taiwanese folk beliefs. The source of the son-in-law has many different opinions on the folk beliefs, including the \"Nine-day Xuan Nuo\", \"The Mother Earth Goddess\", and \"The Laoshan Mother\". These claims have no relevant research in historical classics and Taoist collections. Recorded.",

Another important development is the quantum chemistry that led to the development of quantum mechanics in the 1930s. Linus Pauling made outstanding contributions in this field. At the same time, experimental techniques are also making great strides. The application of various spectroscopy techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy, microwave spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, may be some of the most important scientific and technological achievements of the 20th century. Further developments in physical chemistry may be attributed to some new discoveries in the field of nuclear chemistry before the outbreak of World War II and during World War II, especially in the field of isotope separation, as well as recent discoveries in celestial chemistry and the development of computational algorithms for the physicochemical properties of compounds. In this field, the importance of modern physical chemistry in practical applications is reflected. Both chemical physics and physical chemistry are interdisciplinary subjects of physics and chemistry, but the two are subtle. Chemical physics is mainly to study the characteristic phenomena and physical theories of chemical processes. Physical chemistry mainly studies the physical nature of chemistry. It mainly studies the physical and chemical phenomena by means of theoretical and experimental techniques in atomic and molecular physics and condensed matter physics. Subject.",

Steam locomotives in Germany and the United States have also reached close speeds. This is generally considered to be the speed limit of a steam locomotive. Steam locomotives began to be replaced by diesel locomotives in the twentieth century. In the late 1960s, there were very few countries in the world that used steam locomotives for commercial operations. By the end of the twentieth century, steam locomotives had been largely phased out in North America and Europe, and only on routes that were specially arranged for railroad fans and tourists. There are still very few steam locomotives in Mexico that operate in remote locations. In China, the price of coal in some areas is much lower than that of oil, making steam locomotives still have their value. China was once the last country in the world to manufacture large steam locomotives. The Datong depot in Shanxi has been producing steam locomotives until 1988; Harbin Railway Station still saw a large number of steam locomotives in the mid-1990s, but in the same province. Mudanjiang Railway Station can see a small Japanese steam locomotive parked in the 1930s for people to visit. The number of Chinese steam locomotives has been rapidly decreasing in recent years.

However, as the sequel to the TV animation and the OVA of the film, it became popular. The OVA was also changed to a series of 30 minutes as a TV animation, and the price was more than 5,800 yen. Because OVA's original works are mostly TV animations, and TV animations may have been taken into account when making OVA, OVA may also be broadcast on TV. On the other hand, TV animation will also release DVD/BD and other media soon after the broadcast, so there is still a relationship between OVA and TV animation. The success of the 1995 TV anime \"Evangelion\" also affected this trend. \"Evangelion\" and the past general animation rely on the sponsor to provide funds, but after the TV show, the DVD model is released, and adopts an OVA-like pattern in the production of TV animation. Therefore, the high quality of its animation has achieved great success, which proves that pure audience-oriented TV animation can become a new business model.

          "context": "The Muslim world has several meanings. In the religious sense, it refers to those countries that adhere to Islamic law. In the cultural sense, it refers to Islamic civilization and does not include non-Muslims living in this civilization. In modern geopolitical terms, the term usually refers to a country, region, or town that is predominantly Muslim. The number of Muslims ranges from 1.2 to 1.6 billion, about one-fifth of humanity, and is distributed among many different countries and ethnic groups. Islam emphasizes the unity of Muslim compatriots, although there are many factions. The trend of pan-Islamism and nationalism in the past has influenced the status of the Muslim world. Current reports from various sources estimate that the world's population of Muslims is about 1.2 billion to 1.57 billion, accounting for about 23% of the estimated world population of 6.8 billion in 2009; 62% in the Asia-Pacific region, 20% in the Middle East and North Africa, and 15% in Sub-Saharan Africa, 2% in Europe and the Americas. Among them, the Muslim population in Indonesia, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Turkey, and Egypt accounted for more than 800 million, more than 50% of the total Muslim population. Except for the Mongolian Plateau and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the arid regions of the Eurasian continent are all Muslim worlds. Three-quarters of the world’s Muslims live in climate-ridden places with varying degrees of drought. The Islamic state of the monarchy can be divided into the caliphate, the Sultanate and the Amir. The caliphate is the title of the highest ruler of religion and secularity in the Islamic world. The successor of the Prophet Muhammad is equivalent to the emperor or the emperor. The Sudan refers to the Islamic ruler with independent sovereignty, but does not advocate religious leadership, which is equivalent to the king. The Emir refers to the aristocrats, governors or military commanders who rule a province or region, and has a certain degree of autonomy, but still belongs to the sovereign state, equivalent to the prince or the Grand Duke. No matter what kind of country, in the modern world, it is a country where international law guarantees sovereign independence. In addition, Islamic countries that are not monarchy are often referred to as the Islamic Republic.",

From the historical development point of view, by the 1880s, the region had developed into the largest steel base in the United States, and its steel output accounted for nearly two-thirds of the steel output value of the United States at that time. Before and after the First World War, heavy industry and railway construction in the United States developed rapidly; during the Second World War, the demand for steel increased sharply due to the war; Pittsburgh entered the \"golden period\" of the development of the steel industry. The development of the steel industry has led to regional economic development. Of the top 500 US companies selected by Fortune magazine, 21 are headquartered in Pittsburgh, such as US Steel, Westinghouse Electric, and Alcoa. Metallurgy, coke, heavy-duty electrical manufacturing equipment and glass industries were the pillar industries of the regional economy at that time, and absorbed most of the local employment. However, because the region's economy is too dependent on the steel industry, it has caused problems such as serious environmental pollution, high industrial concentration, and a single employment pipeline. In the 1950s, the government began to transform the Pittsburgh area. By the 1970s, the focus of the transformation had always been urban environmental remediation. At this time, the government began to realize that merely improving the environment is not enough to revitalize the city. It began to formulate and implement regional economic diversification policies and shift the focus of transformation to promoting emerging industries. This policy achieved remarkable results by the end of the 1980s.",

The black top is paired with deep red-tone tights, while the officer is wearing a full-red crimson uniform.

The plane of the altar is round and divided into three layers, all of which are provided with white marble panels. The altar was originally made of blue glazed bricks. After the reconstruction of Emperor Qianlong for 14 years, it was replaced with hard and durable sapphire. Each layer of the railing is engraved with a cloud dragon pattern, and a stone skull is extended outward under each railing for the drainage of the altar. The circular slab in the center of the top is called Sun Stone or Tianxin Stone. Standing on it, shouting or tapping, the sound waves will be reflected by the nearby fences, forming a remarkable echo. Ancient China called the singular number as the positive number and the double number as the negative number. In the positive number, the number 9 is \"the extreme of the positive number\", which means that the celestial body is the highest and the highest, called \"the number of days.\" The number of columns and steps of the banquet of the Qiuqiu is a multiple of 9 or 9. The outer layer of the top round slate is a fan-shaped stone with 9 layers. The innermost layer has 9 stones, and each outer layer is incremented by 9 blocks, as is the middle and lower layers. The number of three-layer fences is 72, 108, and 180, respectively, plus exactly 360. Use the ancient ruler to calculate the diameter of the three-layered altar of the Qiuqiu. The diameter of the top layer is nine feet, the name is \"19\"; the second layer is 15 feet in diameter, the name is \"three five\"; the lower layer is twenty-one feet in diameter. The name \"Thirty-seven\" is used, so that one, three, five, seven, ninety-five \"days\" are used. The sum of the diameters of the three-layered altar is forty-five feet. In addition to being a multiple of nine, it also implies the meaning of the \"Nine-Five\". There are two walls around the altar of the Qiuqiu, the outer circle of the inner circle, and one of the star-shaped gates on each side. There are three lampstands in the southwest corner, and there are chopping wood stoves, shackles, ovens and service desks in the southeast corner.

The internal structure of the Hall of Prayer is quite unique. It does not need girders and long rafts. It only uses agarwood columns and rafts to connect each other to support the roof. After the re-establishment of Guangxu's reign, there are 28 wooden columns in the temple. The number is arranged to match the sky: the central four dragon columns are 19.2 meters high and 1.2 meters in diameter, symbolizing the four seasons. The middle circle has 12 golden pillars symbolizing one year and twelve months. Twelve giant pillars symbolize twelve occasions a day. The middle and outer layers add up to the twenty-four solar terms. The three pillars total 28 and symbolize twenty-eight.

It has since inspired many systems similar to the Brazilian RIT, such as TransMilenio, which was launched in 2000 in Bogota, Colombia. As of November 2013, more than 166 cities have implemented the bus rapid transit system with a total length of approximately 4,336 kilometers. It is estimated that the bus rapid transit system is used by approximately 27 million passengers every day in the world, including 55 bus rapid transit systems in Latin America, which are used by approximately 17 million trips a day in the world, the largest area in the world. The service has 60 of the world's largest route systems in 33 major cities in Brazil, with an estimated passenger population of approximately 19.7 million. In May 2017, China CRRC Group released a new generation BRT system, which is called “Smart Track Express” or virtual track tram, to solve some of the shortcomings of traditional BRT. The system vehicles use IoT technology extensively. Green Energy Technology, the road only needs simple modification, so the cost is very low. The vehicle energy comes from the fast-charged lithium titanate battery. As long as the first two stations are charged, the 25-kilometer route can be completed without the road network. The vehicle is driven on the unreal railroad track of the vehicle body with virtual structure of the camera software. The innovative wheel brake system is fully computerized. The vehicle looks the same as the bus principle, but the ride feel is similar to that of the rail vehicle, and the turning radius is extremely small. Its road network management system uses big data and artificial intelligence to re-plan alternative route detours when road accidents occur.",

The book is one of the most controversial works of the 19th century, and most of its views are generally accepted by the scientific community today. In the book, Darwin first proposed the theory of evolution. He used his own data accumulated during the global scientific study in the 1830s to try to prove that the evolution of species was achieved through natural selection. At that time, Western society generally accepted the creation theory, believed that God created the world, and created all creatures at once, while God also gave each creature its own role, and each species was designed to be perfect, so the species is eternal. consistent. The fossils found in the strata are evidence of a major flood in the ancient earth, and those fossils were animals that did not board the Noah's Ark. The history of the earth is only about six thousand years, which is the time estimated by the human generation after the beginning of Adam and Eve. Darwin was born in 1809 in Shrewsbury, England. Darwin was interested in minerals and animals since childhood. He graduated from the Cambridge Theological Seminary in 1831, but he is still interested in geology and biology. In December 1831, Darwin participated in the naval ship Beagle to South America for natural investigation and research; initially he investigated on the South American coast and repeatedly entered the Galapagos Islands in the west of South America, passing through the Pacific Ocean to New Zealand, Australia and South Africa then returned to South America until October 1836.",

Some of the factory buildings have evolved into places where the Mainland tour groups are now shopping. Because of the old district relationship, there are many elderly homes in the To Kwa Wan area. Since the closure of Kai Tak Airport in 1998, a number of new private housing estates have been completed in To Kwa Wan. Many industrial tenants have also moved to San Po Kong, Kowloon Bay, Kwun Tong and Yau Tong in Kowloon East. However, in recent years, many old neighborhoods have been forced to move away. Old stores are also difficult to compete for expensive rents. It included the \"White House Ice Room\" which has stood in To Kwa Wan for more than 60 years and closed in 2012. In recent years, there have been many free travellers in the district, and there have been many gold shops and pharmacies. Some civil organizations have been stationed in To Kwa Wan since 2014.

The Caribbean Fleet, commanded by the Spanish Admiral Pasqual Severa, was completely destroyed by the United States at the port of Santiago de Cuba. The city of San Diego surrendered to General Sheft. In Luzon, the fleet of US Navy Brigadier George Dewey occupied Manila in the Gulf of Manila. At the same time, the US fleet departing from Hong Kong annihilated the Spanish fleet stationed at the port of Manila, Philippines. The two countries signed the \"Paris Peace Treaty\" in Paris, France on December 10. According to the peace treaty, Spain completely abandoned Cuba and ceded the former colonies such as Puerto Rico and Guam to the United States, which has since completely lost its American colonies. In addition, Spain must sell Luzon to the United States at a cost of $20 million.

He was a victorious squad, and Zhu Xianzhen was a great success, and he defeated Jin Bing. Almost all of his works focus on his personal tragedy and link it to the destiny of the nation. The common paradigm of these descriptions is as follows: In the case of a smooth battle, it was straightforward to go to the Golden Dragon Huanglong House, Yue Fei was recalled by the 12th gold medal of the Southern Song Emperor Zhao, and was executed on charges of \"not necessary.\" These descriptions reflect the unfamiliar \"pan-moralization\" tendency of Chinese society, that is, using moral standards to evaluate political events and portraying political contradictions as ethical conflicts of politicians \"loyalty\" and \"rape.\" It is worth mentioning that Yue Fei was framed to death and died rather than reversed, reflecting the Confucian loyalty and the affirmation of these works. In the Ming Dynasty's \"Huanglong House\", the author adopted an anti-historical stance and rewritten the history as Yue Fei defeated the Jin Dynasty army and \"directed Huanglong.\" Similar propositions about grievances and loyalty can also be found in works such as The Water Margin.",

The industrial enterprises above the scale of Daxing District are petroleum processing, metal products, food processing, electronic machinery, and textiles. Daxing District Panggezhuang Watermelon is famous for its Daxing Watermelon Festival from May 28th to June 4th. The earliest predecessor of Daxing District was Guzhen County, which was named after the construction in Yucheng District. Jixian County was built by Yan State during the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period. In the twenty-third year of Emperor Qin Shihuang, Qin Yucheng District was located in Guangyang County, and Qixian County belonged to it. From the Han Dynasty to the Sui, Tang and Five Dynasties, the establishment of the county has always existed. In 216 BC, Qin ordered \"the dagger from the real field\", and the peasants were able to declare the land, pay taxes, and obtain cultivated land. In the first year of Liaohui, the county was renamed as Yubei County, and it was under the jurisdiction of Youdu. In the first year of Liaokaitai, Yubei County was renamed Zhenjin County; Song Xuanhe was from five to seven years, and Jin County was returned to Song Dynasty, belonging to Yanshan Prefecture. In the second year of the Jin Dynasty, the Yongan government was changed to Daxing, and the county was renamed Daxing County. The Ming Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty set up Daxing County in Beijing (Shuntian House), one of the two Chixian counties. In 1928, it was placed under the jurisdiction of Hebei Province, and the county government was moved from Beijing to Huangcun. In 1958, it was transferred to Beijing, and the old palaces, Yizhuang, Bohai, Xihongmen and other places in Nanyuan District of Beijing were placed under Daxing and renamed Daxing District. In 1960, it was renamed Daxing County. On May 1, 2001, Daxing County retreated from the county to restore Daxing District.",

The multiculturalism centered on Taiwan has made Taiwanese culture more diverse and inclusive. During the reign of Taiwan during the period of Taiwan, Taiwan was called \"Taivoan\". However, during the Ming and Zheng Dynasties, the name \"big staff\" used in the period of the Hezhi period was abandoned, and Taiwan was called \"East Capital\" and \"Dongning\". After being included in the Qing Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty changed to Taiwan as the \"Taiwan\", and \"Taiwan\" became the name of the island. In addition, Taiwan also has other names such as \"Treasure Island\", \"Yuji Island\", \"Peng Lai\", \"Formosa\", \"Fu Mossa\" and \"High Sand\". Taiwan is also known as \"Formosa\" and is derived from the Portuguese word \"Formosa\", meaning \"Beautiful Island\". When the Portuguese ships passed through the sea in Taiwan in 1544, the sailors looked at Taiwan from the sea and found that Taiwan was very beautiful. So he called \"Ilha Formosa\", the Portuguese \"Formosa\" was \"beautiful\", and \"Ilha\" was \"Island\" is translated into a beautiful island. However, there is no direct and clear evidence for this statement. Before the 1950s, it was the main name of European countries for Taiwan. Therefore, Europe has long called the Taiwan Strait a Strait of Formosa.",

On the other hand, if there is a lack of rainwater from the summer typhoon, it will be prone to drought in winter; therefore, dams are generally built in major rivers, water storage and power generation during the rainy season, and water for people's livelihood during the dry season. Taiwan is located in the subtropics and the tropics, and at the junction of Eurasia and the Pacific. The climatic conditions made the early Taiwan benefit the living, and the isolation of the Taiwan Strait caused the species that migrated from the Eurasia through the land bridge during the Ice Age to evolve into endemic species on the island. In addition, the obstruction of the monsoon by the mountains can make the environment in the island change greatly, such as the difference in rainfall. Complex terrain leads to geographical isolation and is conducive to the formation of new species. The Kuroshio currents flowing through the Philippine, Taiwanese, and Japanese waters are also sources of biological resources, on the one hand bringing marine animals and plankton, and on the other hand bringing southern plants.

There were only a few food storage and processing industries and light industries. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Taiwan was repositioned as a southward base by the Japanese government because of its strategic position. Therefore, the military industry was developed in the Kaohsiung area in southern Taiwan. After the National Government moved to Taiwan, Taiwan was regarded as a base for counter-attacking the mainland by force and pursued economic policies of military priority and stable agriculture. Since the 1960s, Taiwan's light industry has developed rapidly, and heavy industry has been in a secondary position. In order to attract investment and increase exports in exchange for foreign exchange, the government also set up processing export zones to increase foreign trade income. In the era of Chiang Ching-kuo, in order to get rid of the oil crisis, the government is committed to promoting the top ten construction and laying a good foundation for Taiwan's petrochemical industry and heavy industry. At this time, it coincided with the Vietnam War, and the United States ordered a large amount of materials from Taiwan. These factors all contributed to the rapid take-off of Taiwan's economy. Due to the success of the economic development, Taiwan has become one of the four Asian dragons in the ranks of the newly industrialized countries. Afterwards, the government noticed the status of heavy industry in the economy and implemented a proactive industrial policy. In Kaohsiung, large-scale heavy industry bases such as large steel mills, large shipyards, and large refineries were built, and American overseas Chinese returned to Taiwan to set up electronics factories, such as Lianhua.

The pirates looted on the coast of China. When they encountered the officers and men, they fled to Penghu and then to Taiwan, becoming another part of the inhabitants except for a few Han nationality. During the same period, the Portuguese were the first European explorers to reach East Asia and colonial Taiwan, but the substantive relationship with Taiwan only ended with the exchange of opium and rice for some of the aboriginal objects, and there was no attempt to colonize further. In 1624, Yan Siqi established Shizhai as a stronghold in Da Nang, and his successor Zheng Zhilong later became the most powerful pirate on the southeast coast of China, and accepted the Ming Dynasty in 1628. In the same year, there was a drought in southern Anhui. Zheng Zhilong once proposed to recruit hungry people to transplant Taiwan. Some scholars believe that this proposal has never been implemented. During this period, Zheng Zhilong had a strong control over the merchant ships on the southeast coast of China and the trade of mainland China against Taiwan. Since the 17th century, there has been a cross-tribal kingdom in the aboriginal people of central Taiwan, which is what the later generations call the kingdom of the big belly. This is also the first political power in Taiwan's historical records. The Dadu Kingdom consists of 27 villages of the Aboriginal tribes such as the Babra, the Cat, the Baqi, the Hongya and the Daojia, and is called the \"Da King\". The scope of the field is from Lukang in the south to the Taoyuan in the north, and is limited to the Daduxi basin in the later period.",

The painting skills were more traditional. Beginning in the 1960s, the new generation of painters introduced Western abstract paintings and other styles, and the art styles became westernized. After the rise of local consciousness in the 1970s, the theme of painting became more localized. After the martial law, the art world is ecologically diverse and its style is increasingly avant-garde. Before the war, local dramas such as Taiwanese operas and puppet shows were very popular among Taiwanese people. In the mid-Japanese period, there were also theater performances such as new dramas. In addition, there are also Japanese traditional arts can be introduced. After the Second World War, due to the promotion of the early government, Chinese operas such as Peking Opera were strongly supported in Taiwan. On the other hand, local operas such as Taiwanese operas and puppet shows are still important entertainment methods for the public.

Many families of birds can live on land and in the sea. Some seabirds are only ashore for breeding, and some penguins can dive to the depths of 300 meters.

For example, homing pigeons can be used to transmit information, falcons can be used for hunting, and ospreys can be used for fishing.

In addition, wild birds that inhabit the airport pose a certain threat to the safety of aircraft during take-off and landing. The flight safety accident caused by the collision between the bird and the plane is called a bird strike. The earliest bird crash in history was recorded in the United States in 1912. The plane piloted by Carl Lodje collided with a seagull over California. The machine is ruined. With the advent of jet aircraft and the development of the human aviation industry, the number of aircraft movements in the world has been increasing, and the problem of bird collision has become increasingly prominent. According to relevant statistics, there are about 7,500 aircraft in the world each year with different degrees of birds. Hit, the loss is as high as 10 billion US dollars. The current main solution to the problem of bird strikes is to disperse birds that inhabit the airport. In particular, it can take different ways of domesticating raptors to drive away, destroy habitats, and make huge and horrible sounds.",

The Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna, Austria is also the only European football five-star football stadium in this competition. It is also a logical course to hold the European Cup final. In the second half of Turkey's semi-final against Germany, the live TV signal was interrupted three times. Due to the thunderstorm in Vienna, there was a signal problem at the International Broadcasting Center in Vienna, and the IBC was responsible for problems with the signals transmitted by the satellite. As a result, TV stations using IBC transmission signals around the world, including China Central Television and Hong Kong now sport, failed to receive TV pictures and missed all the goals in the second half. Because Swiss TV SRG uses the direct reception of signals from the venue without going through the IBC, only SRG can broadcast live, and some TV stations use SRG screens, so they can continue to broadcast live.

          "context": "As early as 1911, Germany had begun to use hybrid railway vehicles, which are railway-powered vehicles that use rechargeable energy storage devices to assist the traction system. When starting, the motor is pushed. When the vehicle accelerates or goes uphill, the engine provides additional power to the traction device to reduce the burden of the main power source. When the vehicle is downhill, the motor generates electricity to recover energy to the energy storage device, so that fuel economy can be achieved, and individual systems can Save 30% to 40% fuel consumption. Hybrid railway vehicles are used in Japan, the United Kingdom, North America and the Czech Republic. Some of the US designs use biofuels in combination with batteries to further reduce carbon emissions. Early hybrid vehicle development focused on trucks and other heavy vehicles. With the advancement of technology and lower costs, hybrid vehicles have been popularized in smaller vehicles in recent years, such as private cars. Hybrid vehicles are more fuel efficient, reducing oil consumption and indirectly reducing overall costs, which will help spread. Due to the decline in overall cost of use, coupled with low carbon emissions, which is in line with the needs of most government environmental policies, public vehicle road public transport vehicles such as buses have also begun to adopt hybrid vehicles in recent years; the world's first hybrid double-layer The bus began service in London in February 2007, and there are now 106 hybrid electric buses in London. Compared to all-electric buses, hybrid bus technology is more mature, there is no need to build additional charging facilities, and in areas where coal is used to generate electricity, its carbon emissions are lower than pure electric vehicles.",

The VK4501 also used hybrid technology heavy-duty combat vehicles. However, the vehicle was only used as a trial type and failed to pass the test. Only 10 vehicles were produced. However, its chassis and drive system were used in the elephant-like re-drive and produced 90 vehicles. In addition, this technology has also been used in the super heavy chariot No. 8 chariot rat type, but the car only surrendered in the prototype stage without energy production in Germany. The technology used in the hybrid chariot at that time was a series hybrid system powered by an engine to drive the motor. Due to the lack of computer control technology, there was no way to use a highly efficient hybrid system, and the problem of cooling and anti-electromagnetic interference.

From the perspective of the future, the original intention of the Kyoto Protocol is to promote environmental protection, but the voice of opposition and criticism has always existed. In addition to affecting the economy and employment, critics also include environmentalists. They questioned that the standards of the Kyoto Protocol were set too low to be sufficient to deal with the serious crisis of the future. Gore’s own environmental position has also been criticized to a certain extent. Critics criticized that Gol warned of the global warming crisis on the one hand, and on the other hand often took a private jet with a large fuel consumption. The position was completely contradictory. As early as January 1998, there have been rumors that Gore will represent the Democratic Party in the 2000 US presidential election. On June 16, 1999, Gore also announced his participation in the party in Tennessee. As the current vice president, he was greatly supported by the Democratic Party. In the case of the party’s primary election, Gower became the Democratic presidential candidate for the 2000 US presidential election. Later on August 13, 2000, he announced the arrival of Senator Joe Lieberman as the vice presidential candidate. The latter is a conservative within the party. The position is more conservative than Gore. It has publicly criticized Clinton’s actions in the \"zipper door\" case. It is generally believed that Gore has given Clinton's \"zipper door\" turmoil to many conservatives in the party, so he deliberately found a conservative figure in the party as the vice president to increase the odds.",

The small Bush that was won was criticized by many people as a president who lacks recognition and holds Gaoer. Some people think that because of the \"zipper door\" incident that happened in the late Clinton administration, the Democratic Party has been implicated, which has affected this election, but this is not the main reason. Gower’s partner, Lieberman, later criticized that Gower adopted a populist style in the election, arguing that it was not a strategy that would enable the Democratic Party to win the election. But even if Gore wins, because the Republican Party still controls the House and Senate, even if the Democratic Party continues to govern, it will be quite difficult. Regardless of the reason, Gore faded out of politics afterwards, and the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections did not appear in the party nomination. After Gower became a world-renowned environmental activist, he often used global warming as his theme for public speaking. In 2006, he launched his own production and performance documentary \"The Unwilling to Face the Truth\", which focuses on the impact of industrialization on global warming and human survival. This film has aroused great repercussions in many countries and won the Best Documentary and Best Film Song Award of the 79th Academy Awards. Under his organization, the Global Earth Global Warming Star Relay Concert was held on July 7, 2007, which was well received by the world. In October 2007, he and the United Nations Organizational Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change won the Nobel Peace Prize, winning the reason that he “awakened the awareness of the dangers posed by climate change”. Gore said on his personal website that he would donate all the prize money to the environmental protection organization he founded, the Climate Protection Alliance.",

The Dirac equation he gave can describe the physical behavior of fermions, explain the spin of the particles, and first predict the existence of antiparticles. He also played a leading role in path integration and secondary quantization, which laid an important foundation for the development of quantum electrodynamics. In addition, he introduced the concept of topology into physics and proposed the theory of magnetic unipolar.

Similarities. Based on this finding, he came to a clearer definition of quantization. In 1925, a paper entitled \"Basic Equations in Quantum Mechanics\" was published. On the other hand, Erwin Schudinger proposed his own quantum theory with the wave equation of matter wave. Dirac had not favored Schrödinger's theory. Instead, Heisenberg sent a letter to Dirac asking him to take a serious look at Schrödinger's theory. Although he ignored the study of Schrödinger in his doctoral thesis, Dirac began to study the wave dynamics of Schrödinger. In September 1926, after receiving his Ph.D., at Fowler's suggestion, Dirac went to the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen for a period of research. During this period in Copenhagen, Dirac continued the study of quantum mechanics and developed a general theory covering wave dynamics and matrix mechanics.",

In 1930, Dirac published his book Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, which is an important milestone in the history of physics. It is still a classic textbook of quantum mechanics. In this book, Dirac combines Heisenberg's work on matrix mechanics and Schrödinger's work in wave dynamics into a mathematical system that links the relationship between observables and the actionors in the Hilbert space. The book also introduces the Dirac function widely used in quantum mechanics. Continuing Dirac's 1939 article, in 1939 he added his mathematical symbolic system, the Dirac symbol, to the third edition of the book. To this day, the Dirac symbol is still the most widely used set of quantum mechanical symbology. In 1932, Dirac succeeded Joseph Larmor as a professor of mathematics at Lucas in Cambridge. In 1933, Dirac and Schrödinger jointly won the Nobel Prize in Physics, which at the time was the youngest award-winning theoretical physicist in history. However, he said to Rutherford that he did not want to be famous and he wanted to reject this honor. Rutherford said to him: \"If you do this, you will be more famous, and people will have to trouble you.\" On December 12 of the same year, Dirac gave a Nobel Prize-winning speech in Stockholm entitled \"Electronics and The theory of positrons.\"",

In 1933, continuing his 1931 paper, Dirac proved that the existence of a single magnetic monopole is sufficient to explain the quantization of charge. In 1975, 1982, and 2009, research results indicated that magnetic monopoles may exist. But so far, there is no direct evidence of the existence of magnetic monopoles. Even so, some large unified theories still contain magnetic monopoles to explain the formation of the universe structure. Dirac's magnetic unipolar is the first to apply the concept of topology to dealing with physical problems. In 1937, Dirac proposed the big number hypothesis. He compared two measures without magnitude: the ratio of the basic forces to the age of the universe, and found that both fell by about 39 orders of magnitude. Dirac guessed that this may not be a coincidence, and there may be some correlation between the two. Referring to the theory of Edward Arthur Milne, the gravity constant is allowed to change over time. Based on these assumptions, he designed a model of his own cosmology.",

When the population is small, alien species are difficult to breed and survive, so a species may need to reach a location many times before it can survive. The cyclical round-trip activities of humans, such as the transportation of ships between ports and the highways of cars, give these species more opportunities. When alien species can compete for indigenous species in competition for nutrients, sunlight, space, water or food, it can become an invasive species. If these species evolved under intense competition or great predation pressure, and there are no competitors in the new environment, these invaders can grow very quickly. For an ecosystem where all resources are fully utilized, each point of invasive species gains is a loss of indigenous species. However, the ultimate extinction of indigenous species caused by this unilateral competitive advantage is not achieved overnight. They can coexist for a considerable period of time. Gradually, when the population of invasive species increases significantly, and gradually adapt to the environment, the competitive advantage also changes. It’s obvious. Invasive species often make use of resources that are not available to indigenous species, such as deep water resources that can be harnessed by strong roots, and can survive in previously unsoiled soil types. A. serrata was introduced to California with low water retention, lack of nutrients, high magnesium and calcium, and soils with heavy metal toxicity. The general plant density in this soil is very low, but the aegilops can grow here and crowd out the indigenous species in these lands.",

The Polish Copernicus first denied the heavenly movement that people had been convinced in the past. Later, the German Kepler developed a model of its planetary operation, proposing that the planet orbits the sun according to its trajectory. At the same time, in addition to constantly emphasizing its ground motion, Galileo of the Italians developed a number of basic mechanics theories. In 1687, the British Newton published \"The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\", which explained in detail two complex and successful physics theories: Newton's laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, which established the foundation of classical mechanics. The study of electrons and magnetism was led by the British Faraday and the German ohm, when it was the nineteenth century. The physics of the early twentieth century also showed revolutionary changes, represented by Einstein. In 1905, he published four epoch-making papers: \"An Inspiring Perspective on the Generation and Transformation of Light\", \"Study on the Motion of Suspended Particles in Static Liquids Based on Molecular Motion Theory\", \"On the Electrics of Moving Objects\" Mechanics, Is the inertia of the object related to the energy it contains?, and then the formula for E = mc2 is derived. This is collectively referred to as relativity, mainly to correct the concept of Newtonian mechanics. This has a profound impact on physics, because Einstein's theory fundamentally revised the knowledge that the past scientific community believed, and it is still discussed today. More inventions emerged during the Second World War. This includes radar and atomic bombs. These technologies will be used by governments in the military in the future and will have a profound impact on future military technology.",

He observed from the origin of crude oil that the crude oil production area was a piece of ocean in the past, and later converted into crude oil due to topographical transformation. In Western Europe, the academic community has always believed in the interpretation of the rock by Theo Frastos until the scientific revolution. In 1700, two Frenchmen, Jane Aitian Goodda and Nicholas Desmarat, traveled in the middle of France and recorded their observations as a map. The former recorded the observation of the first volcano. In 1788, James Hutton published his book The Theory of the Earth, whose theory is called the theory of homogenization. In 1811, two French zoologists, George Cuvier and Alexander Bronnia, published a book on their elephant fossils discovered in Paris, expounding their views on the structure of the earth. This view later became an important theoretical basis for stratigraphy. The \"Geological Principles\" of the British Charlie Lyle further strengthened the view of James Hutton, affecting Darwin's evolution theory in the future. In the twentieth century, geology was more revolutionary. The \"plate tectonics theory\" represented by Wegner further expands the view that the earth's outer shell is composed of plates.",

The settlement of the downstream colonization is called the area of the Erzhongpu area, and the Sanpupu is the last development of a new land, so the triple place name is a pioneering history of an ancestors. During the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty, the large rice blast on the east bank of the Danshui River replaced the status of the upstream Xinzhuang and Sui, and the business became increasingly prosperous, which also led to the development of Sanpu. At that time, the three bridges of Qiaotou Port and Dadao Village were the important ferries to and from the two places, and Sanzhong quickly developed into a lively town. In the fifteenth year of Guangxu, when Liu Mingchuan was the first governor of Fujian governor of Taiwan, for the sake of railway traffic, he had set up a freshwater railway wooden bridge between Mie and Dadao, and promoted the circulation of triple agricultural goods through the railway. Because the bridge foundation of the freshwater wooden bridge was unstable, it was often destroyed by the big water, and it was not repaired. Therefore, during the Japanese occupation period, it was decided to divert the railway. Since then, the three railways have entered history and can no longer hear the sound of the train. In January 1950, the General Administration of Telecommunications moved to Sanchong City, Taipei County.

Until the third century AD, it was recorded that Wei Mingdi, the emperor of the Wei Kingdom in northern China, met with the messengers from the Roman Empire. The Roman messenger sent Wei Mingdi many gifts including glassware. If this record is true, according to the time when the Roman messenger arrived in Wei, these messengers were dispatched by the Roman emperor Alexander Severus after quelling the civil strife. Another record said that in 284, a Roman messenger presented gifts to Emperor Wu. This may be the messenger sent by the Roman Emperor Carus after the Persian War. According to Chinese historical records, businessman Fulin arrived in the Byzantine Empire in 643. The ruler of the Byzantine Empire at the time was Constantine II. It is also recorded that in 667, 701 and 719, Tang Dynasty people arrived in the Roman Empire through Central Asia. The historian's effect, speculative, speculated that the Roman captives sent to the eastern border of Parthenia may have had conflicts with Han soldiers.

They thought that the fish scales in the text might refer to the tortoises of the Roman army. They guessed that the soldiers captured by the Han Dynasty were later in Yongchang. The county village settled down. However, Dabs's assumptions are not accepted by modern scholars. At present, there is no evidence for this hypothesis, and after testing the DNA of male residents near the village, the results also negated this hypothesis. Moreover, the establishment of the county of Zhangye County was earlier than the battle of Wuzhi City, so Jixian County will not be named because of the Roman prisoners.",

In May 1948, Ambassador Fu Bingchang of the Republic of China in the Republic of China took note of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and stated that Tang Nuo Liang Hai was the territory of the Republic of China. However, it was later lost because of the withdrawal from mainland China, and there was no follow-up action. After 1998, the Republic of China officially no longer issued the \"Full Map of the Republic of China.\" In October 2005, the main office abolished the codes of the provinces and cities in the mainland including Donuu Lianghai. The Yearbook of the Republic of China no longer listed the mainland in the chapter of “Land”. In 2006, The Legislative Yuan passed the abolition of the Mongolian League flag law. So far, there is no such administrative division. At present, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that \"in order to respect the consensus of the international community\", it has already recognized that it is one of the 83 \"federal entities, similar states or provinces\" under the Russian territory.

It is their instinct to pick things up so that they can feed themselves. Babies are most likely to be tapped, hugged and stroked. Infants sleep much more than adults, and newborns reach more than 18 hours a day, and sleep gradually decreases with age. The newborn baby's eyesight is only about 0.05, and only the largest \"E\" on the eye chart can be seen. As you get older, you can increase to 1.0 when you are about 2 years old. When a newborn is born or a few days later, he can open his eyes and receive light. At about 6 to 8 weeks, it is possible to stare at the object and turn the line of sight as the object moves. At about 4 months, the stereoscopic effect of both eyes gradually develops, and the objects can be positioned with both eyes. When the baby is still in the mother's body, she can make a mother-like heartbeat in her body and hear the outside world. The baby in the fetus is immersed in the amniotic fluid but can hear the sound. Infants respond more to women's voices than men. When a baby is born, it responds to sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and saltiness. Sweet things are most liked. The smell of birth is very developed.

In the store, it is necessary to avoid damage to the fruit due to collision. If the fruit has been cut, it needs to be refrigerated. Fruits need to be cleaned before consumption, even if the skin is not edible. Cleaning is best done before eating or handling to avoid premature deterioration of the fruit. Fruits should be stored separately from raw meat, poultry, eggs and seafood, and should not be exposed to tableware that comes into contact with the above raw food. If the fruit comes into contact with the above raw food and does not have to be cooked immediately, throw it away.

The exclusive economic zone refers to an area outside the territorial sea and adjacent to the territorial sea. The exclusive economic zone should not exceed 200 nautical miles from the baseline of the width of the territorial sea, except for points closer to another country. The countries to which the exclusive economic zone belongs have the right to explore, develop, use, maintain and manage the seabed and subsoil and the natural resources of the overlying waters, and the right to construct, use, research and protect the artificial facilities. Other countries still enjoy the freedom of navigation and overflight, as well as other international law-related uses related to these freedoms. The country has exclusive rights to exploit or permit the use of fishery resources and mineral resources in its exclusive economic zone. Economic sea areas are not territorial, but they are an extension of national sovereignty. The United Nations Third Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1982 made a resolution on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, with detailed provisions for the exclusive economic zone. The Convention has been ratified by 160 countries, and currently only the United States, North Korea, Iran, Thailand, Libya, etc. have not yet ratified. Generally speaking, large powers or island countries, and still retaining many former colonial powers belonging to the island, are easy to obtain a large space for the declaration of exclusive economic zones. For example, the United States has territories such as Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and Saipan on both sides of the two oceans and on the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, making it the world's largest exclusive economic zone. The United Kingdom and France have used their islands in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans to declare a vast exclusive economic zone, the eighth and second in the world. Australia is a sea-going island surrounded by the sea. In addition to the connection with Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, it can also declare a huge economic zone.",

The British general election is held every five years, the specific date is the first Thursday of May. The British Prime Minister will ask the King to dissolve the Congress after a five-year term, so the term of the British Parliament will not exceed five years. The cabinet members must attend the Congress to defend the policy and accept the supervisor's supervisory inquiry. In addition, if the major bill proposed by the government is not approved by the parliament, it may face a case of no confidence in the parliament. Once the vote of no confidence is passed, it will force the prime minister to resign, and the prime minister will dissolve the parliament and re-elect the general election. In addition to the cabinet, in the functioning of the cabinet system, there are usually other ways in which Congress can express dissatisfaction with the cabinet, which may result in a downfall. The current British House of Lords is not without power. The House of Lords was originally composed of permanent members and hereditary members. Later, the number of hereditary members was reduced to less than 100. The seats were chosen by all hereditary nobility. The House of Lords vetoed the budget, and if the House of Commons is reconsidered, the resolution of the House of Lords will be null and void immediately. If the House of Lords vetoes other bills, the House of Lords resolution will be invalid if it continues to be decided by the House of Commons for two consecutive sessions. So the House of Lords has the power and power to block the bill. Members of the House of Lords may also lose seats due to peer resolutions. The previous case was the First World War, and the House of Lords abolished the aristocratic powers of the European enemy kings. Jurisprudentially, all bills still have to be approved by the British monarch. Moreover, the power of the two chambers still comes from the sovereignty represented by the king, called \"the king is in Congress.\" The previous monarch veto of the Congressional Act was rejected in 1708 by the Scottish Militia Law.",

According to the 1707 Joint Act, the English Parliament and the Scottish Parliament were merged into the Great Britain Parliament. The 1800 Joint Act passed in 1800 merged the Irish Parliament in 1801 to form the British Parliament. In 1066, William I brought his feudal system of the French kingdom to England. He then gave the land to his important military supporters, who in turn gave the land to their supporters to form a feudal hierarchy. Those who get the land directly from the king are called the lords, and their territory is called the pick. William I is an authoritarian monarch, but he also seeks advice from the conference or pre-election before making a law. In 1295, Edward I held a model parliament, which was regarded as a classic example of the future parliament. Representatives of the municipalities were allowed to participate in the parliament for the first time in the conference; since then, each county has sent two knights to the parliament, and each municipality has sent two municipalities to represent the municipality. Initially, the representatives of the municipality basically had no power at all. In contrast, each county has a fixed seat in the parliament, but the municipality has a seat in the parliament, but it depends on the love of the monarch. The representative of a municipality shows the intention of independence, and the municipality he represents is greatly excluded from the parliament. As for the status of the knight, it is better than the representatives of the municipality. However, due to the initial system of the parliament, their power is not as good as the aristocrats and clergy in the parliament.",

For example, during the reign of Edward II, the nobility had supreme authority, the monarchy was restrained, and the representatives of the counties and municipalities were weak. In 1322, Congress first recognized its authority without general practice or royal franchise, but recognized its own authority by means of establishing its authority by Congress itself. During the reign of Edward III, developments went even further. One of the most important is that Congress split into two during its reign: the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The authority of the Congress continued to grow. In the early fifteenth century, the functions and powers of the two chambers reached unprecedented levels. Because of the significant influence of domestic aristocratic politics and clergy, the House of Lords is far more powerful than the House of Commons. The civil war that broke out in the late 15th century was called the Rose War, and the aristocratic forces were weakened again during this period. Many nobles were killed or wounded in battle, or executed because they were involved in civil wars. Many of the nobles’ original industries fell into the hands of the monarchs. What is especially true is that the feudal system was dying, and the separatist forces led by the nobles were devastated. The monarch was thus able to rebuild the authority in the country. The monarchy continued to grow during the reign of the Tudor dynasty in the sixteenth century and reached its peak during the reign of Henry VIII.",

The Joint Commission was created in 2001 to resolve the dispute, but failed to reach a conclusion on this, but instead proposed seven options for adoption by Congress. In a series of confusing referendums in February 2003, all options were not passed, although 80% of the candidates and 20% of the options were only 3 votes away from the threshold. Some Labour MPs supported a complete abolition and opposed all of the above options. A congressional subcommittee proposed another proposal, recommending 70% of the elected members of the whole house. Most of the other places are directed by the committee to pass on skills, knowledge, and experience. The case was also not on the agenda. The new aristocrats were then appointed only by the hospital. The Labour Party has still not stated what kind of system will be proposed for the reform of the House of Lords, and it tends to support Billy Breg's second system of appointment. The House of Commons, with a majority of 337 to 224 votes and 113 votes on March 7, 2007, must support the election of all the House of Lords in the future, and no more hereditary or appointments; the Labour Party’s leader, Jack Straw, said This is a historic and important step in the reform of the House of Lords. Among them, 80% of the members of the House of Lords were originally elected, and the other 20% of the programs still appointed by the government were passed by 305 to 267, a majority of only 38 votes, and it was not possible to require all the House of Lords to pass the elected proposal. Jack Straw said that the House of Lords reform has been discussed for decades. He said: \"Today's vote is a historic and important step in pushing this work, breaking the deadlock in the House of Commons and writing an important page in the history of the British Parliament.\" \"I am very pleased that the political parties have reached a consensus on this and have decided the direction of the promotion.\"",

First, the electors are elected to the Legislative Council, and the parliament composed of Members is then delegated to the Government.

The bottom layer has been restored, and the middle part of the second floor has been rebuilt. At the same time, facilities such as waiting rooms and luggage rooms have been built. In August 1937, the Battle of Shanghai and Shanghai broke out, and Shanghai North Railway Station once again became a war zone and was bombarded by Japanese fighters. At 14:00 on August 28, the Japanese army dispatched multiple fighters and bombed the Shanghai South Railway Station. The building and its ancillary facilities were completely destroyed. At the same time, hundreds of passengers were killed and the railway transportation at the South Station was completely interrupted. On November 12, with the fall of Shanghai in addition to the concession, the Japanese began to dismantle the Shanghai South Railway Station and its nearby 1.5-kilometer railway. At the same time, Shanghai North Railway Station was repaired and renamed as “Shanghai Hao”. Since then, all passenger transportation in Shanghai has been attributed to Shanghai North Railway Station. In 1945, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration took over the Shanghai North Railway Station and began repairing and expanding the station the following year. After the restoration, the station platform was extended to 360 meters, and the platform was expanded to 2,787 square meters to build two waiting rooms.

The main aspects are: the number of people in the Shanghai Station Hall has been expanded to 10,000, and the station area has been expanded to 33,000 square meters; the roads around Shanghai Station have been dredged, the Datong Road non-motor vehicle interchange has been built, and the Hengfeng North Road overpass has been constructed; Construction started within 6 months after approval, completed the first phase of the project before 1987, and completed the second phase of the project before 1988; the total investment of the project was determined to be 267.36 million yuan. On April 11, 1984, the State Development Planning Commission signed the \"Re-approval of the Shanghai Railway New Passenger Station Design Task Book and the Preliminary Design Reply\". On September 20, 1984, the new passenger station project started. In August 1981, after the Shanghai Municipal People's Government received the approval of the State Council, it established the Shanghai Railway New Passenger Station Project Headquarters. In October 1983, the municipal government adjusted the headquarters of the command. A total of four people from the Shanghai Railway Bureau, the Zhabei District People's Government and the Construction and Engineering Bureau served as the command and deputy commanders of the headquarters, and they were stationed at the construction site. In September 1984, the Shanghai Municipal Government determined that the engineering headquarters was the dispatched agency of the municipal government and was fully responsible for station construction. In 1986, the Shanghai Municipal Government established the Shanghai Railway New Passenger Station Project Leading Group. Jiang Zemin, then the mayor, served as the team leader. The leading group of the new passenger station was convened several times and entered the site supervision project. The pre-relocation work for the construction of the project was also started in May 1984. The relocation was carried out by the original method of re-opening the original, and more than 7,600 households and units in the construction area were first moved to other places.

Entering the station can enter through two entrances to the north and south, and at the same time, the soft entrance waiting entrance is set up in the east of the entrance, and the soft waiting room is directly connected. The passengers who get off the bus can quickly exit through the underground passage through a total of three exits in the southeast, southwest and north exits. In addition, 80% of the waiting rooms are located above the platform. Passengers enter through the north-south entrance and are transported by escalator to the second-floor central corridor. There are 5 waiting rooms on the left and right sides of the central corridor. Passengers enter the relevant waiting hall according to the outdoor electronic display instructions of each waiting car. The outside of the left and right side of the waiting hall is connected to each platform through the left and right elevated passages to shorten the passenger's boarding time. The structure has been adopted by many large stations in mainland China. The ground floor hall is mainly composed of a group waiting room, a soft waiting room and a pit stop. In 2003, after the opening of Hong Kong and Macao Free Trade, in order to speed up the running time of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Express train, Shanghai Customs set up entry and exit ports on the ground floor of the station hall and entered the joint inspection hall through special channels. In addition, in order to avoid the hedge between the ticket purchasers and the crowds entering and leaving the station, Shanghai stood at the southeast side of the main station hall, that is, the junction of Meiyuan Road at Fuling Road, and a joint ticketing hall was built. There are more than 40 windows in the whole hall. After the opening of the Yangtze River Delta EMU, the Shanghai Station added an automatic ticketing hall to the east side of the southeast exit to reduce the pressure on ticket purchases in the joint ticketing hall.",

It is bordered by Chad in the east, Nigeria and Benin in the south, Burkina Faso and Marley in the west, Algeria in the north, and Libya in the northeast. The total length of the border is 5,500 kilometers. With an area of 1,267,600 square kilometers, it is the world's lowest development country. From the 8th to the 16th centuries, there were three powerful countries in the upper and middle reaches of the Niger River: the Ghanaian Empire, the Marley Empire, and the Sanghai Empire. The Bornu Empire was raised in the Lake Chad area from the 11th to the 18th centuries. Although the kingdom of Ghana and the ruling center of the Marley Empire were not in Niger, they had a great influence on the region through trade. The western and central parts of Niger were once part of the Sanghai Empire. In 1897, it was occupied by France in 1900 and became a French colony in 1904, which was incorporated into French West Africa. On August 3, 1960, Hamani Diori became the first president. In April 1974, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Saini Conte, launched a coup to seize power. Conche was in power until his death in November 1987, and was succeeded by Ali Saebu. In March 1993, Mahaman Ottoman won the country’s first democratic presidential election, but his government was overthrown by a military coup in January 1996. Tandja Mamadou was elected president in November 1999 and was re-elected in December 2004. He was overthrown by the military on February 18, 2010.",

Subsequently, investors are required to submit relevant certificates of investment in place, and they can formally be allowed to stay in Hong Kong for two years and renew.

It was collectively known as Tsuen Wan New Town. It was originally Yankwa and Sha Tsui along the Tsuen Wan. The river was no longer over. The west coast was also moved from Hoi Po Street to Yeung Uk Road by reclamation. At that time, the Tsuen Wan Ferry Pier was now in the vicinity of the Wah Lai Square and Kwai Chung was converted from a barren land to a container terminal in the late 1960s. Later, it developed into an international freight center, which fundamentally changed the face of the Liwan District. Both population growth and the development of new towns have had a huge impact on the New Territories agriculture. Before the 1950s, agricultural products were mainly rice, but the rice harvest period was long and the water consumption was large. Once the drought was encountered, it was very likely that the crops would fall short. In the 1950s, it was gradually replaced by vegetables that were short in harvest and less susceptible to weather. The second turnaround point In the early 1970s, Governor MacLehose understood that to govern Hong Kong, it must start with Hong Kong as a whole. In the past, the Government had different policies for the management of Hong Kong and Kowloon and the New Territories. Therefore, a number of policy reforms were implemented. The total number of one-way permit applications approved by the Immigration Department is 150. It is estimated that the number of new arrivals will rise after the Central Government has allowed Hong Kong residents to apply for One-way Permit for Hong Kong. As West Kowloon's prices and rents are relatively low, it has become a hub for new arrivals. According to the Home Affairs Department and the Immigration Department, new arrivals from West Kowloon account for 24.5% of the total new arrivals. Because Hong Kong's new immigrants have the largest number of people in Guangfu, most of them are concentrated in the newly moved Guangfu people. Many newly moved Hakkas will live in the New Territories, while the Guangdong Minsheng Department will be in Kowloon East. These regional immigrants are related to the separate settlements of the people in the early years. Of course, many people have been diaspora because of the passage of the Cantonese dialect. However, there are still many people who have taken root in a certain area, because most of their relatives are still in the area, making immigrants Liquidity is reduced.",

The Japanese who first moved to Hong Kong came mainly during the Japanese occupation. They were mainly relatives and friends of the Japanese troops stationed in Hong Kong, but most of them returned to Japan after the war, and only a very small number continued to stay. Despite this, the number of Japanese people in Hong Kong has not decreased significantly. Instead, in the 1960s, the peak of Japanese immigration peaked, so that Hong Kong soon established a Hong Kong Japanese school in BMW Hill, North Point, to provide children of Japanese families. Later Japanese people mainly engaged in business in Hong Kong. Most of them came to Hong Kong during the reform and opening up of China in the 1980s, hoping to use Hong Kong as a jumping version to enter China. Most of them are high-level Japanese companies who work and settle in Hong Kong. They have taken root in Hong Kong, the second generation is generally fluent in Cantonese, and is enrolled in mainstream schools. However, if the family does not intend to settle in Hong Kong, the children will be placed at the Japan International School in order to develop the country.

They lived in Kimberly Street in Tsim Sha Tsui and bought handwritten letters for the crew members coming to Hong Kong or provided them with food in their hometown.

After obtaining the objective conditions, on January 18, 1955, the Battle of the People’s Liberation Army, Yijiangshan Island, attacked Jiangshan Island after a day of fierce fighting. Since Yijiangshan Island is the barrier of Dachen Island, after the loss of a river, Dachen Island is directly exposed to the scope of the PLA artillery. The defense is also relatively difficult. In terms of distance, Taiwan to Dachen Island is larger than mainland China. Chen Island’s distance is far from being easy to maintain and maintain its strength. The PLA’s MiG-15 fighters have an air superiority in the local area. In addition, the Republic of China also signed the \"Sino-US Joint Defense Treaty\" with the United States, while Kinmen, Matsu and Dachen Island are not within the scope of joint defense.

French archaeologist Jacques Cowen said that the Neolithic revolution was influenced by an important theme he called the \"symbolic revolution,\" which showed the birth of \"religion\" in the Neolithic Age. He believes that humans in the Neolithic Age were affected by changes in thought, more than the impact of environmental change, and pointed out a series of stages of this process. His research proposes an important concept of the evolution of human thinking such as perception and duality by examining the earliest females as goddesses and bulls as gods' pottery and early art. The Central European Neolithic ring structure during the 5th millennium BC was interpreted as an educational function. Part of the Goosek Circle, the remains of human sacrifice were discovered. Many of these structures have openings aligned with the sunset or sunrise orientation to the point, indicating that they are a way to maintain the lunar calendar. The construction of the megalithic culture in Europe began in the 5th millennium BC and continued throughout the Neolithic Age, and some areas have already entered the early Bronze Age. Maria Gimbutas, the pioneer of feminist archaeology, proposed the concept of the \"feminine center\" society around the \"Goddess Worship\" in Europe in the Neolithic Age. Later, with the advent of the Bronze Age, the \"matrix\" culture of the Neolithic Age was replaced by patriarchy. However, Kimbutas’s views are not widely supported today.",

These volcanoes are usually smaller than the average size of the mountains of Io, with an average height of only 1 to 2 km and a width of 40 to 60 km. There are also several shield-like volcanoes with a gentler slope. Because the lava flows radially from the center, it is inferred from the morphology that it is a volcano on the Io, such as a volcanic structure. Almost all of the mountains appear to be at the stage of degradation, and the large-scale landslide deposits are common to the foundations of the mountains on the Io, so the collapse is suggested to be the main form of degradation. The common feature of the Fangshan and Plateau of Io is the scalloped edge, which is the result of the infiltration of sulfur dioxide from the crust of Io, leading to the weakening of the edge regions of the mountain.",

The peaks are usually very large, with an average length of 157 kilometers. The isolated structure does not seem to have a global structural pattern, just like the mountains on Earth. Io must have a crust of citrate rock to support these huge peaks, compared to the sulphur-rich crust. Although Io's extensive volcanic activity presents many features, almost all mountains have structures from crustal movement. Most of the peaks of Io are not caused by volcanoes, but instead are formed by the compressive stress of the lithosphere, which is enhanced by the constant turbulence and reverse faults of the Eo's shell. The compressive stress that causes the formation of the mountain is the result of the constant burial of material from the volcanic deposit. The global mountain distribution appears to be symmetrical to the volcanic structure; there are only a few volcanoes in the mountain distribution, and vice versa. This suggests where the lithospheric structure in the large-scale region is controlled by compression and expansion. Regional, however, the mountains and craters are often close together, when the mountains formed and reached the surface, there was a fault formation that caused the erosion of the magma.",

Its design disperses the public powers of various countries and does not concentrate them in a single organ, so that these separate organs can play a check and balance role. This term was first proposed by the British philosopher John Locke in the Age of Enlightenment in his \"Government Theory\", and such a design is usually known by the separation of the three powers proposed by the French philosopher Montesquieu. The three powers immediately legislate, administrative, and judicial powers are respectively exercised by three different functions of state organs, mutual restraint and balance of doctrines and systems. The form of political organization in which the three major government agencies coexist and check each other is a political system adopted by most countries in the world. An important political principle and political system of capitalist countries. The form of political organization opposite to it is the system of parliamentary cooperation. The idea of decentralization can be traced back to Aristotle in ancient Greece. He proposed that the state has the power of deliberation, administration, and judiciary, and that the chaos of the country is transferred by whether the three powers are reconciled. In the modern era, the theory of decentralization was clearly written in the 17th century British Locke. The most important political papers were two \"Government Theories\" written from 1689 to 1690. In 1748, France's Montesquieu was in the book \"The Spirit of the Law\". Develop the theory of Locke and systematically propose the principle of separation of powers. The forms of separation of power include administration, justice, and legislation to solve some of the problems that may arise in the political system. It proposes a plan for replacing the feudal monarchy with a political system after the bourgeois revolution. This doctrine is widely regarded as a powerful guarantee for a democratic system. After the capitalist countries generally implement the separation of powers, the general legislative power is exercised by the parliament, the executive power is exercised by the president or the cabinet, and the judicial power is exercised by the court.",

Compared with the separation of the three powers originated in the United States, judicial independence can be described as the origin of the United Kingdom. The British Prime Minister and the Cabinet usually come from the House of Commons and are responsible to the House of Commons. If the Prime Minister and the Cabinet lose their support or trust in the House of Commons, they may either resign or ask the monarch to dissolve the House of Commons to re-elect. In the past, the British House of Lords had a judicial function, and the members who were responsible for hearing the nobility were called permanent appeal judges. After the Second World War, the judicial function of the House of Lords was basically exercised by the \"Upper House Appeals Appeals Committee.\" This arrangement allows the House of Lords to combine legislative and judicial functions. Since the entry into force of the Constitutional Reform Act of 2005, the House of Lords has no longer retained judicial functions. The Privy Council of the United Kingdom also has certain judicial functions. After 2005, it only has jurisdiction over cases in overseas territories. The British parliamentary system also has considerable influence in countries around the world. For example, after Japan resumed sovereignty in 1952, the issue of \"the bill originated from foreign countries\" was controversial. However, in 1945 and 1946, there were many public discussions on constitutional reform. The Japanese Constitution, which was drafted by the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces of Japan, Douglas MacArthur, was obviously influenced by Japanese liberalism, and the Japanese liberals regarded it. It is the most viable option to replace the Meiji Constitution of European-style authoritarianism.",

The idea of separation of powers is that Sun Yat-sen combines the separation of the three powers with the West and the ancient Chinese political system, and proposes a political system with Chinese characteristics. According to the original constitution, the president is a virtual head of state. The National Assembly is a political institution. In addition to the power to amend the constitution, it also exercises four powers of election, recall, creation, and reconsideration. The National Assembly is responsible for electing the president. The following is the administrative court and the Legislative Yuan. The five courts of the court, the examination court, and the supervisory authority exercise the five powers of administration, legislation, justice, examination, and supervision. In practice, the government of the Republic of China after the constitutional amendment strengthened the power of the executive. The president can directly appoint the president of the Executive Yuan without the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The 2005 amendment to the Constitution freezes the provisions related to the National Assembly, making the Legislative Yuan the sole legislature. After the examination court and the supervisory court changed their power to exercise the consent of the Legislative Yuan, the powers have been greatly weakened, the courts have been transferred to the judicial administrative organs, and the general cases have been handled by the courts at all levels. The powers of the court judges who have set their terms of office have exercised their constitutional review powers. .",

At present, the Romanian Armed Forces budget accounts for 1.33% of Romania's GDP, slightly equal to 1.78 billion euros. In recent years, the equipment of the Romanian Armed Forces has been almost completely renewed, and the Romanian Armed Forces have now become modernized forces capable of carrying out a variety of combat and non-combat missions. The Soviet-made MiG-21 fighters being used by the Air Force will be replaced by modern F-16 fighters previously serving in the Portuguese Air Force by 2016. In the first phase, 12 fighters will be sent to Romania, and then 12 more will arrive in the country by 2020. In order to replace the old fleet of transport aircraft, the Air Force also acquired seven new C-27J Spartan transport aircraft.",

In lean manufacturing systems, industrial engineers are committed to eliminating waste of time, money, materials, energy, and other resources in the production process. They make the product quality stable and easier to manufacture, and finally increase production. Unlike most specialized fields of application in engineering disciplines, industrial engineering is widely used in almost every industry. For example, how to shorten the long queues in front of the theme park, optimize the operation method, global cargo delivery, and manufacture more affordable and reliable vehicles. The name industrial engineering is easy to misunderstand. At first, industrial engineering was called scientific management, and now, industrial engineering in Korea and other countries is called industrial engineering, which is more in line with its current application. It was originally used in manufacturing, but now it is widely used in other related services and industries. Industrial engineering is also often referred to as operational management, systems engineering and engineering management. In order to reduce the engineering and design costs of a project, the population is often broken down into components that can be designed and manufactured at one time and that can be applied to many similar products. For example, a typical tape player has a tape deck manufactured using precision injection casting, which is manufactured and inspected by a small factory and supplied to a much larger company as a component. The tool design cost of this deck is averaged by a large number of different models, and other products only need to design a suitable mounting position.",

The acquisition is based on the media assets of the South China Morning Post Group, including the paper and online editions of the South China Morning Post, magazines and outdoor media, at a consideration of HK$2,060.6 million. Cai Chongxin, executive vice chairman of Alibaba Group, revealed that the online payment content of the South China Morning Post will be completely free in the future. He also said that he will guarantee the independence of the editor. At that time, some analysts believed that this move would make the South China Morning Post's reporting style gradually inclined to the mainland and lose its independent position. However, the topic and content of the English version of the South China Morning Post did not change significantly. The newspaper supports Hong Kong's comprehensive universal suffrage and the abolition of the Legislative Council functional constituency. It does not oppose the Beijing government. However, it has criticized the Beijing government's policies and supported peaceful reform and peaceful reform. Oppose China's campaign to deify the past leader Mao Zedong and support the Hong Kong workers' treatment campaign. The newspaper’s comments have criticized the Pan-French and the founding factions. In addition, he is critical of Japanese nationalism. In 2012, the Hong Kong media generally reported on the second day after Li Wangyang’s death, and the South China Morning Post only published a newsletter in the A6 edition. On June 7, a foreign part-time editor of the South China Morning Post, Price, wrote to the editor-in-chief Wang Xiangwei, who believed that this was self-censorship. Internal leaked emails show that the retail version of the report was personally slashed by the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Wang Xiangwei, and faded into a more than 100-word newsletter. In a few days, Price disclosed to all his colleagues an email exchanged between him and Wang Xiangwei about the incident, and said that the incident made the credibility of the South China Morning Post at stake.",

Li Zezhen plans to pay a special dividend after the completion of the acquisition, and then liquidate the PC. China Netcom Group, the second largest shareholder of PCCW, objected to this plan because Netcom had signed an agreement with PCCW when it entered the company, and Netcom had to agree when it changed hands. However, since this plan only involves the sale of assets and does not involve the company's equity, Netcom's objections have no effect and will not affect the success of the transaction. However, the Ministry of Information Industry of China believes that the telecommunications network involves national security and interests and should not be owned by foreign investors. Therefore, the Chinese government expresses its opposition through China Netcom and on the other hand exerts pressure on Li Ka-shing and Li Zemin through political channels. On July 10, Citigroup Senior Consultant Liang Bojun said in Hong Kong that his wholly-owned company spent HK$9.16 billion to acquire a 23% stake in PCCW, which is controlled by PCCW, at a price of HK$6 per share.

Since the shareholder's gains were less than the sale of assets to HK$60 billion, PCCW plunged 8.11% after the resumption of trading on July 11, falling to HK$5.1, which completely offset the special dividend yield.

First, he sent Liu and the Axis to attack the Xiangyang, and the history was called the battle of Xiangfan. In 1274, the Yuan army captured Fuyang, and Song sent Lu Wenhuan to surrender. Later, Zhongshu Yuxiang Shi Tianze and the Privy Council made Bo Yan lead the army to the south of the Yangtze River and set up a goal. In 1275, Lu Wenhuan led the Yuanshui Lulian Army to defeat Jia Zhidao's Southern Song Shuijun in Wuhu. The history was called the Battle of Ding Jiazhou. In the next year, the Yuan army captured Lin'an, and the Queen Mother Xie and Song Gong emperor surrendered to the Yuan army. However, Lu Xiufu and other 7-year-old Song Duanzong was in Fuzhou, and Wen Tianxiang, Zhang Shijie and Chen Yizhong continued to fight against the Yuan in Jiangxi, Fujian and Guangdong. The Yuan army successively attacked various parts of southern China. In 1278, the Southern Song Dynasty court retreated to Guangdong Yashan. In March of the following year, Zhang Hongfan attacked the Southern Song Dynasty Navy in the Yashan Battle. Lu Xiufu died with the 8-year-old emperor Song Youzhu, who was thrown into the sea, and died in the Southern Song Dynasty. The Yuan Dynasty unified the Chinese region and ended the split of more than 520 years since the Anshi Rebellion in the Tang Dynasty. Before and after this, the Yuan Dynasty had asked some neighboring countries or regions to surrender and join the tributary relationship of the Yuan Dynasty, but was refused. Yuan Shizu sent troops to attack these countries. Among them, the Yuanist War that invaded Japan was the most famous because Fan Wenhu was not properly commanded. The typhoon struck and failed. Because the Yuan court needed to reward a large number of treasures to the aristocrats, and the expenses were heavy, the finances became increasingly tense, and the courtiers disputed for financial problems. They split into the Confucianists led by Xu Heng and other Han Chinese and the Mongolian Mongols, and Ai Hema and Lu Shirong. Sangge and other color-minded people and Han people led the financial management. The Confucian scholars believe that Yuan Ting should save money and reduce taxes. The financial management thinks that the South has a large amount of possessions and should be confiscated to solve the financial problems of the court. Since Yuan Shizu trusted Ahema, set up Shangshu Province to solve the financial problem. Confucian scholars competed with Ahema with the core of the princes who are deeper in Chinese. Finally, Ahema was assassinated, and Prince Zhenjin died because of illness. However, Yuan Shizu did not trust the Confucian faction, and still used the financial management officials to solve the financial problems, leading to fiscal deterioration.",

Because the four great Khanates and the old-fashioned Mongolian royal family were dissatisfied with the actions of the Yuanshi ancestors to practice Hanfa, they were rebellious or alienated. Yuan Shizu gradually alienated from Confucianism in his later years, and appointed the financial management heads led by Ahema, Lu Shirong and Sango, and Han Chinese. Hanfa did not become a complete system. Later Yuan Renzong, Yuan Yingzong, Yuan Wenzong and Yuan Huizong were able to use Chinese to create their skills. Some Mongolian nobles who have settled in the Central Plains admire Chinese culture and have invited Confucian scholars to teach their children as family teachers. In order to facilitate the study, many Chinese classics have been translated, such as \"Tongjian Festival\", \"The Analects of Confucius\", \"Mencius\", \"University\", \"The Doctrine of the Mean\", \"Zhou Li\", \"Spring and Autumn\", \"Xiao Jing\" and so on. However, Chonghan and the old school often have conflicts and coups, such as the change of the southern slope. In terms of talent selection, the imperial examinations were rarely held in the early Yuan Dynasty. Therefore, the appointment of senior bureaucrats was determined by the relationship between Yuan and Ting, and the system of hereditary, graceful and referral systems was adopted. In addition, there is still a way to promote the bureaucratic, which is very different from the Song Dynasty system. The boundaries between the officials of the Song Dynasty and the ancestors were clear, and most of them ended in shackles. However, because of the lack of imperial examinations, the Yuan Dynasty was promoted to officials by means of referrals or examinations. This broke the bureaucracy and made the bureaucrats a relationship. .",

Guantian mainly comes from the official land of Song and Jin, the land of the emperor, the dignitaries, the land of the tyrants, the land of plundering, and the land of unclaimed people formed by long-term war. Yuan Ting took part of the official land that he had mastered as Putian, and part of it rewarded the royal aristocrats and monks of the monasteries. The rest was directly recruited by the government to collect the land rent. The number of its fields is extremely large, covering the whole country, with Hebei and Henan provinces the most. Among them, the folk songs were used to make the Han people collect rents, and the military squadrons were distributed to the military units, forcing the equivalent of slaves to \"drive the Ding\". Private land is the land of Mongolian aristocrats and Han landowners and a small number of farmland owned by farmers. The Yuan Dynasty rewarded temples with a large amount of land. For example, in 1316, Yuan Renzong gave 200 yuan to Jiangyin Temple in Shangdu Kaiyuan Temple and 100 hectares in Huayan Temple. The Yuan Dynasty also had a certain number of self-cultivators, but its status was very low and life was very difficult. The animal husbandry policy of the Yuan Dynasty was to open up pastures and expand the shepherding and breeding of livestock, especially the stifling horses. The development trend of animal husbandry is unstable, and the prosperity of Yuanshizu gradually tends to decline. When Yuanhuizong was born, the decline of animal husbandry was more serious. The biggest cause was natural disasters.",

The victims also often The Yuan Ting was sent to the grain and sent back to the headquarters. The Yuan Emperor gave huge rewards to the kings, princesses, heirs, and honours. The purpose was to consolidate the unity between the nobles and bureaucrats to maintain their imperial rule. The emperor’s huge reward for Mongolia’s native land is an investment in animal husbandry production in this region. The production of handicrafts in the Yuan Dynasty has also made some progress. The development of the silk industry is mainly in the south, and the ripples in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are the first in terms of output, surpassing the Yellow River Basin. The gold silk fabric of the Yuan Dynasty was called \"Na Shi Ya\" Jin Jin. At that time, the woven gold brocade included two major categories: one was woven by the gold method, and the gold brocade woven by this method was dazzling. The other type is woven with round gold, which is strong and durable, but its golden color is dim. The cotton textile industry changed from the beginning of the Song Dynasty to the beginning of the Song Dynasty. Cotton was quickly introduced into the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Guanzhong Plain from the northwest and southeast. In addition, the Yuan Dynasty set up a Kapok Lift Division in five provinces and districts, and “retained 100,000 horses for the elderly.” It can be seen that the cotton production in the Yangtze River Basin has been considerable. However, due to the simplistic tools and low technology, the finished products were still rough. Around 1295, the women Huang Daopo brought the textile technology of the Li nationality in Hainan Island to the Wusong of Songjiang Prefecture, which upgraded the textile technology and was revered as the Huang Niangniang.",

The emperors of the Yuan Dynasty were subject to the commandments of Tibetan Buddhism, and Tibetan Buddhism was gradually extended to various parts of Mongolia. However, the money used by the royal family for Buddhist affairs accounts for half of the state's fiscal expenditure. The temple also has a huge industry, and some lamas are also arrogant and ill-advised, endangering society. For example, at the time of Yuan Shizu, the Jiangnan Buddhist President Lama Yang Lanzheng liked to dig the tomb. He had excavated more than 100 graves of the Song Dynasty and the ministers. The sheltered civilians did not lose the rent, reaching 23,000 households. The rest were like the industry. It is more common to rape women and other things. Taoism has flourished since the Song Dynasty. During the Jin Dynasty and the Southern Song Dynasty, there were three schools of Quanzheng, Taiyi and Daoism. The Quanzhen religion was founded by Wang Zhe, arguing that there is only one virtue in filial piety, and then learning. When Genghis Khan was in the Western Expedition, he invited the Taoist Qiu Chuji to travel west to Central Asia. He was very courteous to him, and he was in charge of the Taoism of the world. Qiu Chuji later wrote a book entitled \"Changchun Real People's Journey to the West\" with his disciple Li Zhichang, which has important historical value. The avenue teaches that the bitter festival is dangerous, and it does not take advantage of people. It is not extravagant to self-sufficiency. It is passed from the founding teacher Liu Deren to Qi Xicheng, and is enshrined as a real person of Taixuan and is in charge of teaching affairs. Taiyi teaches the practice of teaching Taiyi and Sanyuan, and from the birth of the teaching master Xiao Baozhen to Li Jushou, Yuan Shizu built the Taiyi Palace and let him live in it. However, the Yuan Dynasty used Tibetan Buddhism as the state religion. Yuan Shizu had ordered the burning of some \"accompanied and untrue\" Taoist scriptures such as \"Lao Zihua Hu Jing\", but still enshrined the various masters to appease it.",

Since the color-colored people are good at financial management, Yuan Shizu used the color-colored people after he unified China and gave great power. These have made Islam prevalent in western China, Yunnan, etc. Some of the color-changers have settled in the coastal areas of Guangzhou, Quanzhou, Hangzhou and Yangzhou, gradually forming a large dispersion and small concentration, covering almost the whole country. Between 1357 and 1366, there was a military disorder in Fujian, and it was said that it was also a squad. At that time, the Minister of Mongolia and the Minister of the Republic also believed in Islam. Among them, Anshi Wang Ananda was a devout Islam.

The Republic is threatened by force. On March 14, 2005, the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China passed the Anti-Secession Law with a high vote, and for the first time clarified the principle of \"one China\" in the form of statute law. The Taiwanese people are dissatisfied with this matter. On March 26, they called on hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets of Taipei to express their strong dissatisfaction and protest. Since April 26, 2005, the Kuomintang, the People First Party, and the New Party have visited China's mainland. This has triggered a wave of cross-strait political exchanges.

The government has therefore adjusted its economic policy, adopted the \"second import substitution\", and launched a series of large-scale public investment projects such as the top ten construction. The domestic investment environment has been greatly improved, which has effectively boosted employment and a strong recovery. The economy succeeded in achieving transformation and upgrading. Taiwan has become a newly industrialized country, and is ranked among the four Asian dragons in Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore. In the late 1980s, Taiwan faced a series of factors that were not conducive to investment, such as rising land prices, rising awareness of environmental protection, worsening public security situation, and prosperous labor awareness. The government then once again promoted economic transformation. In 1980, the government set up the Hsinchu Science and Technology Industrial Park to encourage domestic and foreign manufacturers to invest in high-tech industries such as integrated circuits and computers. It hopes to replace traditional industries with technology-intensive technology industries with high added value. Then Taiwan's economy became increasingly liberalized and internationalized. In 2001, it joined the World Trade Organization in the name of individual tariffs in Taiwan, Taiwan and Malaysia. After joining the WTO, the Taiwan market continued to open up, and a large number of foreign products hit Taiwan's industry, with agricultural products and people's livelihood industries. At the same time, in order to reduce production costs, a large number of enterprises have moved outside China and Southeast Asia, causing the phenomenon of industrial hollowing out. Economic liberalization has also caused fierce competition in the domestic financial industry, causing problems such as potential financial risks. In response to these problems, the government has different measures to target Taiwan as an Asia-Pacific operation center during the Lee Teng-hui period. Afterwards, how to improve its own productivity, diversify the economy and improve scientific research and development capabilities, and let enterprises root in Taiwan are all issues facing the Taiwan economy.",

The beautiful island incident that took place in Kaohsiung City in December 1979 was the most far-reaching democratic struggle against Taiwan's democratization in the late 20th century. The subsequent military trials of arrested people were even more noticeable. In the Jiangnan case that occurred in 1984, the image of the government was greatly damaged and it was under strong pressure from the United States. Then Chiang Ching-kuo said in 1985 that the next president would no longer be served by the Chiang family. The Jiangnan case became one of the key events that prompted Taiwan to resolve its martial law in 1987. The March 7 incident, which occurred in Xiaojinmen four months before Taiwan’s July 15th settlement, became the last major human rights violation in the Republic of China’s martial law and mobilization. With the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, the rule of the two generations of Jiang’s father and son ended, and began to develop toward democratic politics. In 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded the president by constitution, but at that time the Kuomintang’s power was still huge. Jiang Songmeiling tried to prevent Lee Teng-hui from acting as the KMT’s acting chairman but was unsuccessful. On May 1, 1991, former President Lee Teng-hui announced the cessation of the turmoil period, representing the government of the Republic of China no longer denying the legitimacy of the regime of the People’s Republic of China. During his tenure, Lee Teng-hui promoted democratization and Taiwan's localization policy, and successively promoted six constitutional amendments. The nationals elected in mainland China in 1947 and have not been re-elected declared their resignation in 1991.",

At the same time, local production and exports were extremely small, resulting in a sharp decline in Indian national industry. The jute industry of the global industrial revolution is an exception. Historians estimate that due to the rapid decline of the sub-continental national industry, its economy has reduced from about 25% of the world's total GDP in 1800 to only one-tenth of the 20th century. The first step in British India's self-government began in the late 19th century, appointing a governor's advisor composed of Indians and establishing a provincial council composed of Indians; with the enactment of the Indian Parliament Act of 1892, it expanded to include legislation. Establish local self-government organs and local administrative regions, and the scope of elections will be extended to Indians. The Indian government passed the reform bill in 1909, the Mora-Minto reform, which gave Indians limited powers in central and provincial courts. After the reform, some were elected, and the main members of the central and legislative courts continued to be appointed by the government. At the provincial level, the governor is accountable to the legislature and other members are elected, informally appointed or officially appointed. John Morley’s clear legislation shows that the establishment of an autonomous government is not the goal of the British government.",

The leader of the Kirafat movement, through the symbol of Islam, unites the Muslim community in India and negotiates with the Congress and the British authorities on the protection of minority rights. The result of the Amritsar tragedy directly led to Mahatma Gandhi’s participation in the Kira Fatat movement from Deoband’s Theological Seminary to the Aligarh Muslim University, which also played a leading and demonstration role in mass participation; for the British colonial authorities It directly led to the violent and uncooperative cooperation of the whole people in 1920 and 1921. Gandhi recognized the status of the Kirafat movement and therefore made Hindus make concessions to Muslims. The Kira Fat movement, despite its mammoth momentum, ended in failure. Turkey abandoned traditional Islamic politics and became a secular state. In addition, the Kira-Fat movement’s mass base brought by religion also alienated constitutional politicians like Western background such as Muhammad Jinnah. Jinna was forced to go to NUS.

On January 13, 2011, the Tajik parliament voted and decided to return it to China’s 1,000 square kilometers, the territory abandoned by the People’s Republic of China in the 1997 Sino-Tower Border Treaty. However, opposition leader Kabiri criticized that Tajik unconditionally sent the land. To the People’s Republic of China, it represents a major defeat in Tajik’s diplomacy. However, Tajik Foreign Minister Zarifi believes that this is a big victory for Tajik, because China originally claimed to have a territory of up to 28,000 square kilometers. Hong Lei, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, said at a regular press conference that the territorial disputes between the two countries have been fully resolved. He said: \"According to the results of the equality consultation between the two countries, the territorial disputes between the two countries will be comprehensively resolved in accordance with the provisions of international law.\" Hong Lei said that after the settlement of territorial disputes with Tajikistan, the two sides will be able to carry out greater cooperation and exchanges in the future. .",

It is generally believed that the military voice is spread with the northern soldiers of the Weifang River flowing through the south of the Yangtze River. The Mandarin is the basic sound, which combines Cantonese, Minnan, Hakka and many other dialects. Therefore, as long as it is one of Mandarin or three other languages, It is very easy to understand this dialect. In the past, some people joked that \"it will speak the military and go through the world.\" In general, people who know the sound of the military can understand the other three dialects. This combination of a variety of dialects makes the protection of military sounds very difficult. It is easier to change with the sound of dialects commonly used in nearby cities.

Accordingly, the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China requested the North Sea Fleet to strengthen its observations on the Sasebo and Okinawa naval bases of the United States and Japan, and to conduct all military exercises conducted by the US and Japanese navies on the western Pacific Ocean at 20°-30° north latitude for the future development of the Military Commission. Basic information was provided in response to the war in the Taiwan Strait.

The deformed dragon is about 24 meters long. They lived in the Early Cretaceous, from 138 million years ago to 112 million years ago. Their fossils were found in England and Portugal. Fossils contain a humerus, spine, a sacrum, pelvis, limb fragments, and skin marks; they cover hexagonal scales. The deformed dragon was the first sauropod to be identified as a dinosaur, but it was not the earliest discovered sauropod dinosaur. In 1841, Richard Owen discovered whales, but classified them as large marine life, similar to crocodiles. It was not until Gideon Mantel identified the deformed dragon as a dinosaur that the whale dragon was also a dinosaur. The complex classification history of the deformed dragon and the whale dragon. The model of the whale dragon is a short-body whale, which was founded by Richard Owen in 1842 based on several fossils discovered in the Early Cretaceous. Several fossils were later found to belong to the poultry dragon. In 1849, Melville named part of the fossil material as the Kang's whale. But some of them should be fossils of poultry dragons, and fossils of sauropods should be reclassified as short-body whales. Therefore, the Kang's whale is a sub-objective synonym of short-body whales.",

During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the Kingdom of Italy was transferred to Napoleon III to return to the French army in Rome. The troops attacked the Papal State attached to France and occupied the city of Rome. At that time, Pope Pius IX was trapped in the Vatican, the Pope. The country is in ruin. In the face of this situation, the successive Popees were reluctant to give in and narrowed their activities to the Vatican Palace, known as the \"Prison of the Vatican.\" The confrontation between the Holy See and Italy has lasted for 49 years. In order to resolve this dispute, since 1926, the then Prime Minister of Italy, Benito Mussolini, represented the Italian government and negotiated with the Holy See and then the Secretary of State, Peter Gaspari, on the settlement of the Roman issue. Finally, three agreements were reached and officially signed at the Latrang Palace in Rome on February 11, 1929, which became the reason for the name of the treaty. After the Rutland Treaty was signed, the Papal State officially disintegrated and was replaced by the newly established Vatican City State. On February 11, it also became the anniversary of the establishment of the Vatican City State.

The caliber of the barrels, most models without scales, a small number of more non-aligned stars, caliber generally reached 18.2 mm. The most common shotguns are generally classified into hunting, athletics, military and policing purposes. This gun type has a large diameter but a low initial velocity. The muzzle kinetic energy is similar to that of a sniper rifle, but because the initial velocity is low and the penetrating and long-range effects are not prominent, it is easy to release energy at a close target. It is extremely lethal at close range and is also suitable for shooting fast targets, but not for long distance or well protected targets. Most of the single shotguns are single or double tubes, no filling device, only firing needles. Its barrel is almost a sliding tube. Because it has no filling device, it is light and convenient. It is often loved by the people for hunting and self-defense. Hunting shotguns mostly use single-shot and rear-loading structures according to the competition. Generally, they are designed with double barrels, and each barrel has an independent launching mechanism, which is mostly the hinge between the starter and the barrel. Shell and re-bounce.

The Greek version of the New Testament records that Jesus was detained by the Jewish religious leaders to the Roman emperor to the Jewish Governor Pilate, and was later sentenced. Therefore, the Christ Cross is also an important symbol of Christianity. In European and American literature, the cross is generally used as a metaphor for suffering. The cross as a torture device has been popularized in the Babylonian Persian Empire, the Damascus Kingdom, the Kingdom of Judah, the Kingdom of Israel, the Carthage and the Ancient Rome. It is often used to kill rebels, pagans, slaves, and people without citizenship. In the society at the time, this form of death penalty was a taboo. Due to the large amount of resources consumed, only a few people are usually killed in a year, and the object is extremely heavy. In 337 AD, Roman Caesar Constantine ordered the ban on this torture. In addition to the annual Easter in the Philippines, the believers who wish to experience the crucifixion of Jesus also use this instrument as a ritual. The shape of the torture device is two logs that are shaped like a cross. Before the execution, the prisoner will first travel across the street carrying the cross until he walks to the execution place. The method of execution is to open the prisoner's hands horizontally, and use long nails to pass between the two bones of the forearm, nail the arm on a crossbar, and then place the crossbar on a vertical piece of wood, then put the feet together. Nailed on the straight wood, then put the cross up and let him die slowly. If the prisoner has not died before the time limit expires, the caretaker will interrupt the prisoner's legs and accelerate the death of the prisoner. Because the cruel crucifixion is unable to make the room with sufficient expansion of the lungs into the fresh air because the back is close to the cross, it is necessary to rely on the legs to prop up the whole body when breathing, so that the back slightly leaves the cross. If the legs are interrupted, the prisoner will not be able to prop up the body and eventually die due to lack of oxygen.",

In the presence of shackles, one or several of their wives receive the seals of Queens, Queens, and Princesses according to their husband's title. The rest of the wife or the diverticulum received a lower rank. There are also examples of unmarried cases of a wife or a diverticulum.

In some areas or times, the main room was firstly enshrined after the monarch was enthroned, and after a while it was booked as a queen, queen or king. There are also some monarchs in the main room because of falling out of favor, crime, low birth or other reasons. After the monarchy was in place, it was only booked as a beggar. There are also cases where the diverticulum is sealed and the main room is only sealed.

Former Yan Murong set up official school, and the textbooks \"Tai Shang Zhang\" and \"Dian Yu\". After the Qin and Nanliang, the law was set up, and the local schools were recruited. This has prompted the various ethnic groups in the North to accept the Han culture, which has positive significance for national integration. The poems and gifts that were handed down at that time may not be widely spread because of the low artistic value.

In terms of folk songs, the famous ones are generally preserved in the \"Luogu Corners\" of \"Folk Songs\". Among them are the \"Civil Songs\" from the Yi people, the \"Song of the Kings\" from the Yi people, and the \"Mu Rong's Songs\" from the Xianbei.

This marks a turning point in the development of international environmental politics. In the mid-1970s, many people thought that environmental disasters were imminent. The return to the land movement began to take shape, and environmental morality thoughts were combined with other political issues such as the anti-Vietnamese war sentiment. These people live outside the normal society and begin to accept more radical environmental theories such as deep ecology. During this period, more mainstream environmentalism began to show its strength. In 1973, the Endangered Species Act was passed. In 1975, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora was established. The United States has passed important amendments, such as the Clean Air Act and the Water Purification Act. In 1979, British scientist James Lovelock published Gaia: A New Perspective on Earth Life, proposing the Gaia hypothesis; it believed that life on Earth could be considered a single superorganism. This became an important component of dark green ideology. In the post-environmentalism history, there is a debate between the radical supporters of dark green ideology and the more mainstream environmentalists.",

For example, in Europe, when smoked the sun, Edward I of England announced in London in 1272 that it was banned from burning coal. This fuel is very common in the UK and can be transported from the shore by hand cart. The early sea coal was named after it. In the early Middle East, the caliph Abu Bakr ordered the troops to \"do not hurt trees or arson to burn trees,\" and \"do not kill enemy animals and keep food.\" Arab medical papers from the 9th to the 13th centuries were discussed. Environmentalism and environmental science, including pollution, the authors include Kendi, Ibn Sina and others. Their work covers a range of issues related to pollution, such as air pollution, water pollution, land pollution, poor handling of municipal solid waste, and environmental impact assessments in some areas. The environmental movement was originally created during the industrial revolution during the increase in atmospheric soot pollution. The emergence of large factories and the consequent surge in coal mining led to unprecedented air pollution in industrial centers; after 1900, a large amount of industrial chemicals were discharged, and untreated human waste was dumped. In 1863, Britain passed the first large-scale modern environmental law, the Alkali Industry Act, to manage the toxic air pollutants emitted by LeBron's alkali-based process for the production of sodium carbonate. The alkali industry inspector and four assistants were appointed to control pollution. The gradual expansion of inspection responsibilities led to the passage of the 1958 Alkali Industry Order, which included all major heavy industries that produced soot, grit and exhaust.",

The practice of building small cooperative farms has attempted to restore ancient country traditions without “deterioration in manufacturing or festering of man-made objects”, which swarmed, including Morris dances and the Maypole style. These ideas also inspired the various environmental organizations in Britain, such as the Royal Bird Protection Association founded by Emily Williamson in 1889, which advocated more protection for the birds on the island. The association is trying to attract more support from the suburban middle class and other influential figures, such as ornithology professor Alfred Newton. By 1900, public support for organizations had grown to more than 25,000 members.

This new type of activity combines the conservative ideas of Thoreau, Leopold and Muir, and applies powerful advertising, lobbying, and letters. The use of powerful photographs combined with letters can be traced back to the creation of Yosemite National Park, and the photo persuaded Abraham Lincoln to permanently protect the beautiful glacial landscape. The Sierra Club Exhibition Typography series spurred public opposition to building dams in the Grand Canyon of Colorado, protecting many other national treasures. The Sierra Club often unites and leads other environmental organizations, including the Wilderness Society. After focusing on protecting the wilderness in the 1950s and 1960s, the Sierra Club and other organizations expanded their boundaries and included other topics, such as focusing on air and water pollution, population issues, and the exploitation of natural resources. In 1962, American biologist Rachel Carson published \"Silent Spring\". The story tells about the environmental problems caused by the abuse of DDT in the United States and questions about the large number of applications before the impact of chemicals on ecology and human health has been understood. The story suggests that DDT and other pesticides cause cancer, and agriculture threatens wildlife, especially birds. These public concerns led to the establishment of the US Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, which subsequently banned DDT agricultural applications in 1972. In some parts of the world, the application limits of DDT on carriers have been controlled to this day, and controversy continues. The influence of the work is not only the awakening of environmental protection, but also the interest of humans in affecting the environment. This environmental interest extends to air pollution, oil spills, and continues to rise. New pressure organizations emerged, such as the famous Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, as well as local organizations such as the Wyoming Outdoor Association established in 1967.",

Nearly six months later, on January 14, 1911, they arrived at the eastern corner of the Ross Ice Shelf.

When the Eight-Power Allied Forces marched into China in 1900, Russia sent troops across the Heilongjiang River on the grounds of protecting the Middle East railway. It set fire to the city that belonged to the Qing Dynasty at that time, and created the Hailan bubble tragedy, and went deep into the Qing Dynasty for about 40 kilometers. Soon after the end of the war, the 66-year-old Jiangdong, which was under the jurisdiction of the Qing government, was occupied by force. In 1907, part of Jiangnan was built in Heilongjiang Province. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have always used the Heilongjiang River as the basic boundary, and shelved the sovereignty dispute over the coastal land. However, Sino-Soviet relations have gradually deteriorated since the Zhenbao Island incident, and the two countries’ armed forces have traveled to the Heilongjiang River, causing a critical situation in the Heilongjiang region. It has only eased since the late 1980s. In the 1970s, with the continuous strengthening of China's reform and opening up, Heilongjiang Province signed a large number of trade agreements with Russia, and several cities along the Yangtze River, such as Heihe City and Tongjiang City, and Russia's Blagoveshchensk, Khabarovsk and other Far East. The city has become a border trade city, using complementary resources to promote the economic development of the Heilongjiang River Basin. China and Russia successively determined the trend of the eastern boundary between the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century. The Chinese side gave up the sovereignty requirements of a large amount of land acquired by Russia in the middle of the 19th century, as well as the occupied 64-year-old Jiangdong. It is agreed to divide the border between the two countries with the actual control line, namely the central line of the main channel of Heilongjiang and Wusuli River. The current boundary has been determined. However, the Republic of China has never recognized the legitimacy of the Russian occupation of the 64-year-old Jiangdong.",

Although Vonte himself was not a constructivist, his student Edward B. Tickiner became a constructivist thinker and opposed to functionalists. Tikkinner is an important figure in early American psychologists. Functionalism is born of structuralism and is influenced by American philosopher, scientist, and psychologist William James. James believes that psychology should have practical value, and psychologists should find scientific ways that benefit people. His book \"Principles of Psychology\" was published in 1890, and there are many paving questions that provide direction for follow-up scientists. Other major functionalists include John Dewey and Harvey Carl.

Throughout the twentieth century, psychoanalysis led to different branch schools, many of which were divided into new Freudian schools. Psychoanalysis and its treatment have been criticized by many people, such as psychologist Hans Eysenck and philosopher Carl Popper. Popper is a scientific philosopher who believes that psychoanalysis is wrong as science, while Eysenck claims that psychoanalytic principles do not match experimental data. By the end of the twentieth century, the Psychology Institute of American colleges and universities became more inclined to positivism, marginalized Freudian theory, and nicknamed it a historical antique of \"dry and old\". At the same time, researchers maintain Freud's scientific position in the field of neuropsychiatry, while other humanities scientists stick to Freud \"not a scientist at all, but an interpreter.\"",

Ogurchak accepted him in order to deal with the Saman dynasty and placed him in Atushi. Thus, under the influence of the exiled savior of the Saman dynasty, Satuk Bograhan converted to Islam and named Abdu Karim. While the prince of Nasr prompted Satok to convert to Islam, he also gave him the hope of regaining the sweat with the help of Islam. Later facts also proved that this practice worked well, and the volunteers from the Islamic world played an important role in the confrontation with their uncle, Ogurchak. In 955, Satuk Bograhan died in Atushi shortly after regaining his sweat. The local area still has his grave. During his lifetime, there were no other important political activities. After the succession of his son Muss, he continued to promote Islamization of the Turks in the country. According to the Arabic history book, in the year 960, there were 200,000 accounts of Turks who accepted Islam. Harun Bograhan, the grandson of Satuk Bograhan, went to the Saman dynasty in the middle of the river from the Eight Diagrams of Satay. In 992, he captured his capital, Bukhara. In 999, he united with another Turkic dynasty in Afghanistan. The monarch of the Ghazni dynasty, Ma Hemu, destroyed the Saman dynasty. From then on, the Karahan country has the Central Asia region north of the Amu Darya.",

As a common written language of the Islamic Turkic world at that time, Hakania has left a large amount of literature and profoundly influenced the common written language of later Turkic. This period also produced the earliest Turkic translation of the Qur'an.

Their singers, Chen Huilin and Xu Zhi’an, were transferred to Taiwan’s Super League Recordings in Taiwan, but the Fuma’s singers continued. It is handed over to Zhengdong Records for distribution and promotion. In other regions, it is responsible for Universal Music. Now even the Hong Kong branch is responsible for Universal Music. In 2002, Zhang Renfeng and Mr. Zhang Gengyu bought back 60% of their shares from Universal Music. Fumao once again became an independent record company. The name of Fumao was changed back to the original \"Linfair Records Ltd.\" and the new trademark was launched. Although he has withdrawn from Universal Music, Fumao continues to represent Decathlon in Taiwan. In addition, Fumao also represented the American high-quality independent label Chesky in Taiwan. During this period, the former Fumao record singers such as Yu Chengqing and Zhou Huimin also returned to Fumao.",
